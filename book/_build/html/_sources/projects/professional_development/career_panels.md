# Career Panels

As part of the professional development activities, career panels are planned to **bring a variety of professionals across different sectors and career stages together** to share their unique career experiences in climate-related fields that can inspire students’ career exploration beyond the program of Climatematch Academy.

Career panels will be a series of **live moderated panel discussions** including live Q&A with participating students. These live panel discussions will take place on Tuesday, July 25th (W2D2). The career panels will usually be in the last hour of the time usually reserved for tutorials. The three scheduled time slots for the career panels include:
* 8:00 - 9:00 UTC for groups in timezone slots 1 and 2
* 14:30 - 15:30 UTC for groups in timezone slot 3
* 20:30 - 21:30 UTC for groups in timezone slots 4

Although each career panel has a targeted student groups based on time zone, you are always invited to join any career panel events that lie outside of your course schedule and work for your personal schedule. Career panel events are great opportunities for students to have direct interactions with professionals in climate-related fields and peer CMA participants and volunteers. You are encouraged to use these opportunities to expand your professional networks!
