Regarding vegetation land cover (e.g., forests, grasslands, agricultural fields, etc.), vegetation sequesters carbon, which reduces the greenhouse effect but absorbs more radiation and reduces earth albedo, which counteracts carbon sequestration. In this project, we will evaluate the albedo change vs. carbon sequestration over the past 24 years. In addition, we will track significant land use changes, specifically agricultural land creation, and abandonment. \n","\n","**In this project**, you will be given the opportunity to explore terrestrial remote sensing and meteorological data from MODIS and MERRA-2 to extract reflectance, albedo, and meteorological variables and information on land cover change in your region of interest.

Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua (originally known as EOS PM-1) satellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). These data will improve our understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a vital role in the development of validated, global, interactive Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough to assist policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the protection of our environment ([https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/](https://academy.climatematch.io/courses/2023-computational-tools-for-climate-science)). \n","\n","Before running the code please read : https://amanbagrecha.github.io/post/rs_gis/download-modis-data-using-cmr-api-in-python/ \n"],"metadata":{"id":"iYblWn8cZAGT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Import the libraries\n","\n","from modis_tools.auth import ModisSession\n","from modis_tools.resources import CollectionApi, GranuleApi\n","from modis_tools.granule_handler import GranuleHandler\n","from typing_extensions import Literal"],"metadata":{"id":"drh-swqCsb9k"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#download_modis.py\n","username = \"\"  # Update this line with your username \n","password = \"\"  # Update this line with your password\n","# 1) connect to earthdata\n","session = ModisSession(username=username, password=password)\n","\n","# 2) Query the MODIS catalog for collections\n","collection_client = CollectionApi(session=session)\n","collections = collection_client.query(short_name=\"\", version=\"\") # Collection short name + version\n","# Query the selected collection for granules\n","granule_client = GranuleApi.from_collection(collections[0], session=session)\n","\n","# 3) Filter the selected granules via spatial and temporal parameters\n","Israel_bbox = [] # format [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max] # add min lon,min lat, max lon and max_lat input your preferred location\n","Israel_granules = granule_client.query(start_date=\"\", end_date=\"\", bounding_box=Israel_bbox)   #choose the start and end dates for the year-month-day you prefer\n","\n","# 4) Download the granules\n","GranuleHandler.download_from_granules(Israel_granules, session, threads=-1) \n","#NB the file format will be downloaded in hdf \n"],"metadata":{"id":"mZMo14eJs26r"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The following links could help students in preprocessing the MODIS dataset  \n","- https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/multispectral-remote-sensing/modis-data-in-python/\n","\n","- http://www.hdfeos.org/zoo/LAADS/MYD08_D3.A2009001.006.2015088160849.hdf.py\n","\n","- https://www.moonbooks.org/Articles/How-to-read-a-MODIS-HDF-file-using-python-/"],"metadata":{"id":"nODD9jDmLdAY"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["However these were what i adopted from the code and how students could visualise the data \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9UbbKMMQbI0C"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# from pyhdf.SD import SD, SDC\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","file_name = 'D:/modis/modis.hdf'  #path + downloaded modis data\n","\n","file = SD(file_name, SDC.READ)\n","file.info()\n","datasets_dic = file.datasets()\n","datasets_dic = file.datasets()\n","print(datasets_dic)\n","for idx,sds in enumerate(datasets_dic.keys()):\n","    print( idx,sds )\n","  sds_obj = file.select('Npp_500m') # select the data variable \n","\n","data = sds_obj.get() # get sds data\n","\n","print( data )\n"," import pprint\n","\n"," pprint.pprint( sds_obj.attributes() )\n","  for key, value in sds_obj.attributes().items():\n","      print( key, value )\n","      if key == 'add_offset':\n","          add_offset = value  \n","      if key == 'scale_factor':\n","          scale_factor = value\n"," data = (data - add_offset) * scale_factor\n"," data\n","\n","# Plot the data\n","plt.imshow(data, cmap='jet')\n","plt.colorbar()\n","plt.title('Npp_500m')\n","plt.show()\n"],"metadata":{"id":"BlAQNu898z5s"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The following papers could assist in processing of MODIS dataset: \n","- https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/7/554 \n","\n","- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431161.2018.1430913\n","\n","- https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/6/6/5368"],"metadata":{"id":"ldDmgK_7Lmy4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##**MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2)**\n","\n","Further background on the dataset could be found at https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/ .
