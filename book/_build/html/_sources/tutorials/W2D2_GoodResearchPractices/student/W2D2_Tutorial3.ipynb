    "\n",
    "What physical processes must be included?\n",

    "  <li>You don't want an approach that contains less than the bare minimum. For some phenomena, we know what the bare minimum is. For others, more research is needed...</li>\n",
    "  <li>If you are unsure about what physical processes are needed, check the literature!</li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "What spatial and temporal resolution is necessary to capture the phenomenon?\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>GCMs can typically have a spatial resolution around 100km and time resolution of several hours.</li>\n",
    "<li> For phenomena that require higher resolution, you can either </li>\n",
    "<ul><li>Use a more idealized model that resolves smaller scales</li><li>Implement a parameterization of the sub-gridscale features within the GCM.</li>\n",
    "  </ul></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "What restrictions do I have for computational resources?\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>If you do not have access to large computational resources, you can still do research using smaller datasets or idealized models</li>\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Am I interested in looking at a particular time period or a specific physical location?\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Reanalysis can be used for time periods after roughly the 1940s</li>\n",
    "  <li>Proxy data can be used for a wider historical and prehistorical data</li>\n",
    "  <li>Both reanalysis and proxy data can provide specific location information</li>\n",
    "  <li>Models can be designed to mimic the conditions of the location or time, for example:</li><ul>\n",
    "  <li>GCMs (General Circulation Models or Global Climate Models) can be set according to parameters that resemble the time period</li>\n",
    "  <li>Energy balance models can capture some aspects of average temperature in other time periods</li>\n",
    "  <li>Radiative-convective equilibrium models can capture some phenomena in the tropics</li>\n",
    "  <li>Quasi-geostrophic models can capture some phenomena in the mid-latitudes (between ~30-60 degrees)</li>\n",
    "  <li>And many more!</li>\n",

    "  </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Am I interested in studying a feature of the phenomenon in isolation or interactions between multiple features?\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>If you want to isolate a single aspect of the phenomenon, an idealized model may be more appropriate</li>\n",
