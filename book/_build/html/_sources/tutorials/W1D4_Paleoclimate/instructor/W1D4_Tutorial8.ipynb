    "# **Summary**\n",
    "In this tutorial, you explored the role of climate models in paleoclimate research, particularly focusing on data from PMIP3. You learned to analyze and plot time series of paleoclimate model simulations, specifically GMST anomaly data from the past 1,000 years. This data reveals a trend of relatively stable global mean surface temperature anomalies from 800-1800 AD, followed by a noticeable rise in temperature over the last two centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you have learned to compare this model data with proxy-based reconstructions. Using the example of temperature data from Lake Tanganyika in East Africa, we've assessed the differences and similarities between the model and proxy data. This process not only enhances our interpretation of the proxy record but also improves our understanding of how well climate models simulate past climate variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next and final tutorial for today, you'll explore another tool for assessing past climate variability using both proxies and models."
