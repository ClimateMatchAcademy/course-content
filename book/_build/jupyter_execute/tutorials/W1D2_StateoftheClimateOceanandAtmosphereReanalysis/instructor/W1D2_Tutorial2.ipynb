    "In the previous tutorial, we learned about ENSO, which is a specific atmosphere-ocean dynamical phenomena. You will now examine the atmosphere and the ocean systems more generally.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn to work with reanalysis data. These data combine observations and models of the Earth system, and are a critical tool for weather and climate science. You will first utilize two methods to access a specific reanalysis dataset (ECMWF's ERA5; through [PO.DAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/) and through the web Copernicus API). You will then select and mask a region of interest, investigating how important climate variables change on medium length timescales (hours to months) within this region.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Access and select reanalysis data of cliamtically-important variables\n",
    "- Plot maps to explore changes on various time scales.\n",
    "- Compute and compare timeseries of different variables from reanalysis data."

    "**Reanalysis** refers to the process of combining historical observations from a variety of sources, such as weather stations, satellite measurments, and ocean buoys, with numerical models to create a comprehensive and consistent record of past weather and climate conditions. Reanalysis data is a useful tool to examine the Earth's climate system over a wide range of time scales, from seasonal through decadal to century-scale changes. \n",

For the purposes of this tutorial you will be using a product from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) called **ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5)**.

    "A point on Earth is described by latitude-longitude coordinates relative to the zero-meridian line going through Greenwich in London, UK (longitude = 0 degree) and the xero-latitude line along the equator (latitude = 0 degrees). Points east of Greenwich up to the *dateline* on the opposite side of the globe are referenced as 0 to +180 and points to the west of Greenwich are 0 to -180. -180 and +180 refer to the same longitude, the so-called *dateline* in the central pacific. \n",
