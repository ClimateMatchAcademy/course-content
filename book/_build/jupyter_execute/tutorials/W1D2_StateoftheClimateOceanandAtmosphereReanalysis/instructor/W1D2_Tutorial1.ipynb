    "# **Section 1: Introduction to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)**\n",
    "In W1D1 you practiced using `Xarray` to calculate a monthly climatology, climate anomalies, and a running average on monthly global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data from the Community Earth System Model v2 (CESM2). You also used the `.where()` method to isolate SST data between **5ºN-5ºS and 190ºE-240ºE (or 170ºW-120ºW)**. This geographic region, known as the **Niño 3.4 region**, is in the tropical Pacific Ocean and is commonly used as a metric for determining the phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO is a recurring climate pattern involving changes in SST in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, which has two alternating phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **El Niño:** the phase of ENSO characterized by warmer than average SSTs in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, weakened east to west equatorial winds and increased rainfall in the eastern tropical Pacific. \n",
    "*   **La Niña:** the phase of ENSO which is characterized by cooler than average SSTs in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, stronger east to west equatorial winds and decreased rainfall in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Section 1.1: Tropical Pacific Climate Processes**\n",
    "To better understand the climate system processes that result in El Niño and La Niña events, let's first consider typical climate conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Recall from W1D1, **trade winds** are winds that blow east to west just north and south of the equator (these are sometimes referred to as \"easterly\" winds since the winds are originating from the east and blowing toward the west). And as we discussed yesterday, the reason that the trade winds blow from east to west is related to Earth's rotation, which causes the winds in the Northern Hemisphere to curve to the right and winds in the Southern Hemisphere to curve to the left. This is known as the **Coriolis effect**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If Earth's rotation affects air movement, do you think it also influences surface ocean water movement? It does! As trade winds blow across the tropical Pacific Ocean, they move water because of friction at the ocean surface. But because of the Coriolis effect, surface water moves to the right of the wind direction in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left of the wind direction in the Southern Hemisphere. However, the speed and direction of water movement changes with depth. Ocean surface water moves at an angle to the wind, and the water under the surface water moves at a slightly larger angle, and the water below that turns at an even larger angle. The average direction of all this turning water is about a right angle from the wind direction. This average is known as **Ekman transport**. Since this process is driven by the trade winds, the strength of this ocean water transport varies in response to changes in the strength of the trade winds. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Section 1.2: Ocean-Atmosphere Interactions During El Niño and La Niña**\n",
    "So, how does all of this relate to El Niño and La Niña? Changes in the strength of Pacific Ocean trade winds and the resulting impact on Ekman transport create variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean SST, which further results in changes to atmospheric circulation patterns and rainfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "During an El Niño event, ***easterly trade winds are weaker***. As a result, less warm surface water is  transported to the west via Ekman transport, which causes a build-up of warm surface water in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This creates warmer than average SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The atmosphere responds to this warming with increased rising air motion and above-average rainfall in the eastern Pacific. In contrast, during a La Niña event, ***easterly trade winds are stronger***. As a result, more warm surface water is transported to the west via Ekman transport, and cool water from deeper in the ocean rises up in the eastern Pacific during a process known as upwelling. This creates cooler than average SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. This cooling decreases rising air movement in the eastern Pacific, resulting in drier than average conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll examine SST temperatures to explore variations in the climate system that occur during El Niño and La Niña events. Specifically, we will plot and interpret CESM2 SST data from the Niño 3.4 region."

    "In this tutorial, we have learned to utilize a variety of Xarray tools to examine variations in SST during El Niño and La Niña events. We've practiced loading SST data from the CESM2 model, and masking data using the `.where()` function for focused analysis. We have also computed climatologies and anomalies using the `.groupby()` function, and learned to compute moving averages using the `.rolling()` function. Finally, we have calculated, normalized, and plotted the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), enhancing our understanding of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its impacts on global climate patterns."
