# # **Tutorial Objectives**
# 
# In Tutorials 1-4, you will learn about the process of research design. This includes how to
# 
# 1.   Identify a phenomenon and formulate a research question surrounding it
# 2.   Efficiently review existing literature and knowledge about the phenomenon
# 3.   Identify what is needed to study the phenomenon
# 4.   Formulate a testable hypothesis regarding the phenomenon
# 
# By the end of these tutorials you will be able to:
# 
# *   Understand the principles of good research practices
# *   Learn to view a scientific data set or question through the lens of equity: Who is represented by this data and who is not? Who has access to this information? Who is in a position to use it?
# 
# # **Demos**
# 
# In order to illustrate the process, we will use a sample research question about how the surface temperature of the earth depends on the CO$_2$ content of the atmosphere.

# # **Activity: Asking Your Own Question**
# 
# Write down a phenomenon you would like to gain understanding about. Take 5 minutes to construct a question about the phenomenon. Discuss amongst your group to improve the question. For some inspiration:
# 
# *   Are there other aspects of the planet that may influence the average surface temperature?
# *   Are there other features of the planet that may be impacted by changes in the average surface temperature?

# ## **Make Sure to Avoid the Pitfalls!**
# <details>
# <summary>Click here for a recap on pitfalls</summary>
# 
# Question is too broad
# <ul>
#   <li>Science advances one small step at a time. Narrowing the scope will help clarify your next steps</li>
#   </ul>
# 
# Question does not identify a precise aspect of the phenomenon
#   <ul>
#   <li>Clarity will help identify next steps in your research</li>
#   <li>If you are struggling to identify a precise aspect, you might need to learn more about the phenomenon. Look to the literature (Step 2)!</li>
#   </ul>
# 
# Question is about an analysis method
#   <ul>
#   <li>An analysis method is a tool, not the big picture</li>
#   </ul>
