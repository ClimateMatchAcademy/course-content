# In this tutorial, we will analyze datafrom five different CMIP6 models developed by various institutions around the world, focusing on their *historical* simulations and low-emission projections (*SSP1-2.6*). By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to 
# - Load CMIP6 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data from multiple models;
# - Calculate the SST anomalies, and recall the concept of temperature anomaly in relation to a base period

# # **Section 1: Load CMIP6 SST Data from Five Models and Three Experiments**
# In the previous section, you compared how a single CMIP6 model (*TaiESM1*) simulated past temperature, and how it projected temperature would change under a low-emissions scenario and a high-emissions scenario (*historical*, *SSP1-2.6* and *SSP5-8.5* experiments respectively). 
# 
# Now we will start to analyze a **multi-model ensemble** that consists of data from multiple CMIP6 models. For now, we will focus on just the historical simulation and the low-emissions projection.
# 
# Your multi-model ensemble will consist of:
# 
# *  **Five** different CMIP6 models developed by institutions from a variety of countries: 
#   * *TaiESM1* (Research Center for Environmental Changes, Taiwan),
#   * *IPSL-CM6A-LR* (Institut Pierre Simon Laplace, France),
#   * *GFDL-ESM4* (NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, USA), 
#   * *ACCESS-CM2* (CSIRO and ARCCSS, Australia), and 
#   * *MPI-ESM1-2-LR* (Max Planck Institute, Germany). 
# 
# Note that these are only a subset of the dozens of models, institutes, countries, and experiments that contribute to CMIP6, as discussed in the previous W2D1 Tutorial 2 video. Some of the abbreviations in the model names refer to institutes (*MPI/GFDL*), while some refer to the complexity and version of the model (e.g., Earth System or Climate Model [*ESM/CM*] and low- or high-resolution [*LR/HR*]). There are often several models from a single institute with each having a distinct level of complexity.

# ### **Coding Exercise 1.1: Combine Past Data and Future Data, and Remove Seasonal Oscillations, and plot all 5 of the CMIP6 models we just loaded**
# 
# * The historical and projected data are separate time series. Complete the `xr.concat` function to combine the historical and projected data into a single continuous time series for each model.
# * The previous timeseries oscillated very rapidly due to Earth's seasonal cycles. Finish the `xarray` `resample` function so that it smooths the monthly data with a one-year running mean. This will make it easier to distinguish the long-term changes in sea surface temperature.
# * Note: this code is already set up to use all 5 of the CMIP6 models you just loaded, as it loops through and plots each model in the DataTree [`dt.keys()`]

# ### **Question 1.1**
# 
# 1.   Why do you think the global mean temperature varies so much between models?* 
# 
# **If you get stuck here, reflect on the videos from earlier today and the tutorials/videos from the Climate Modelling day for inspiration.*

# [*Click for solution*](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/tree/main/tutorials/W2D1_FutureClimate-IPCCIPhysicalBasis/solutions/W2D1_Tutorial_3_Solution_23243afa.py)
# 
# 

# ### **Coding Exercise 1.2**
# 
# As you just saw, the global mean SST varies between climate models. This is not surprising given the slight differences in physics, numerics, and discretization between each model.
# 
# When we are looking at future projections, we care about how the model's *change* relative to their equilibrium/previous state. To do this, we typically subtract a historical reference period from the timeseries, which creates a new timeseries which we call the temperature *anomaly* relative to that period. **Recall that you already calculated and used *anomalies* earlier in the course (e.g., on W1D1).**
# 
# **Modify the following code to recreate the previous multi-model figure, but now instead plot the global mean sea surface temperature (GMSST) *anomaly* relative the 1950-1980 base period (i.e., subtract the 1950-1980 mean GMSST of each model from that model's timeseries)**
# 
# *Hint: you will need to use `ds.sel` to select data during the base period ([see here](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/indexing.html#indexing-with-dimension-names) under "Indexing with dimension names" for a helpful example) along with the averaging operator, `mean()`.*

# In[ ]:


# calculate anomaly to reference period
def datatree_anomaly(dt):
    dt_out = DataTree()
    for model, subtree in dt.items():
        # find the temporal average over the desired reference period
        ref = ...
        dt_out[model] = ...
    return dt_out


dt_gm_anomaly = datatree_anomaly(dt_gm)

_ = ...

plt.title("Global Mean SST Anomaly from five CMIP6 models (base period: 1950 to 1980)")
plt.ylabel("Global Mean SST Anomaly [$^\circ$C]")
plt.xlabel("Year")

# 
# 

# ### **Questions 1.2: Climate Connection**
# 
# 1.  How does this figure compare to the previous one where the reference period was not subtracted?
# 2.  This figure uses the reference period of 1950-1980 for its anomaly calculation. How does the variability across models 100 years before the base period (1850) compare to the variability 100 years after the base period (2080)? Why do you think this is?

# 
# 

# # **Summary**
# 
# In this tutorial, we expanded on the previous examination of a single CMIP6 model (*TaiESM1*), to instead work with multi-model ensemble comprising five different CMIP6 models (*TaiESM1*, *IPSL-CM6A-LR*, *GFDL-ESM4*, *ACCESS-CM2*, and *MPI-ESM1-2-LR*) developed by institutions around the world. We demonstrated the importance of anomalizing each of these models relative to a base period when calculating changes in the simulated Earth system. If variables are not anomalized, these absolute values can differ significantly between models due to the diversity of models (i.e., their distinct physics, numerics and discretization).
