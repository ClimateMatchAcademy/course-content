# # **Tutorial Objectives**
# In this tutorial, we will learn about the concept of internal climate variability, how it influences the predictability of climate phenomena and how it contributes to uncertainty in CMIP6 models. We will work with a *single-model ensemble*, which utilizes the *MPI-ESM1-2-LR* model from CMIP6, to isolate and quantify internal climate variability. 
# 
# By the end of this tutorial, you would be able to:
# - Understand the importance of internal climate variability and its role in climate prediction and model uncertainty.
# - Create and evaluate a single-model ensemble using IPCC uncertainty bands, providing a visual representation of model uncertainty.
# - Contrast the uncertainty due to internal variability against the uncertainty within a multi-model ensemble (which includes internal variability *and* the impacts of human/coding choices).

# # **Section 1: Internal Climate Variability & Single-model Ensembles**
# 
# One of the CMIP6 models we are using in today's tutorials, *MPI-ESM1-2-LR* is part of single-model ensemble, where its modelling center carried out multiple simulations of the model for many of the CMIP6 experiments.
# 
# Let's take advantage of this single-model ensemble to quantify the internal variability of this model's simulated climate, and contrast this against the multi-model uncertainty we diagnosed in the previous tutorial.

# ### **Coding Exercise 1.1**
# 
# Complete the following code to:
# 
# 
# 1.   Load 5 different *realizations* of the *MPI-ESM1-2-LR* experiments (*r1i1p1f1* through *r5i1p1f1*). This numbering convention means they were each initialized using a different time-snapshot of the base/spin-up simulation.
# 2.   Plot the *historical* and *SSP1-2.6* experiment data for each realization, using a distinct color for each realization, but keeping that color the same across both the historical period and future period for a given realization.

# 

# # **Summary**
# In this tutorial, we explored the internal climate variability and its implications for climate modeling and prediction. We discussed the utility of single-model ensembles for isolating the effects of internal variability by contrasting simulations with identical physics, numerics, and discretization. We quantified the internal variability of *MPI-ESM1-2-LR* model's simulated climate and compared it to the uncertainty introduced by multi-model ensembles. Through this tutorial, we better understand the boundaries of climate prediction and the different sources of uncertainty in CMIP6 models.
