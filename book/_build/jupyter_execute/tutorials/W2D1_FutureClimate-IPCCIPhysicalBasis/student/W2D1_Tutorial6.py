# # **Tutorial Objectives**
# In this tutorial, we will synthesize scientific knowledge from various sources and use this diverse information to validate and contextualize CMIP6 simulations. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to 
# - Create a time series of global mean sea surface temperature from observations, models, and proxy data;
# - Use this data to validate & contextualize climate models, and to provide a holistic picture of Earth's past and future climate evolution.

# # **Section 1: Reproduce Global SST for Historical and Future Scenario Experiments**
# 
# We are now going to reproduce the plot you created in Tutorial 4, which showed the likely range of CMIP6 simulated global mean sea surface temperature for historical and future scenario (*SSP1-2.6* and *SSP5-8.5*) experiments from a *multi-model ensemble*. However, now we will add some an additional  dataset called *HadISST* which is an observational dataset spanning back to the 1870. Later in the tutorial, we will also include the paleo data you saw in the previous mini-lecture.
# 

# ## **Section 1.1: Load CMIP6 SST Data from Several Models using `xarray`**

# Let's load the five different CMIP6 models again for the three CMIP6 experiments.

# ### **Coding Exercise 1.1**
# 
# Complete the following code to:
# 
# 
# 1.  Calculate a time series of the global mean sea surface temperature (GMSST) from the HadISST dataset
# 2.  Subtract a base period from the HadISST GMSST time series. Use the same base period as the CMIP6 timeseries you are comparing against.

# ### **Questions 1.1 Climate Connection**
# 
# Now that you have a modern and projected time series containing models and observations,
# 1. What context and/or validation of the simulations does this information provide?
# 2. What additional context/validation can you glean by also considering the paleo proxy information in the figure below? (This figure was shown in the last video)
# 
# Note the paleo periods on this figure represent the Mid-Pleiocene Warm Period (MPWP), the Last Inter-glacial (LIG) ad the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)
# 
# ![](./img/W2D1_Tutorial_6_Insert_Figure.png)
# 
# This image shows part of panel a) from Figure 9.3 from the IPCC AR6 WG1 report. This figure has the following caption: **Figure 9.3** | Sea surface temperature (SST) and its changes with time. (a) Time series of global mean SST anomaly relative to 1950â1980 climatology. Shown are paleoclimate reconstructions and PMIP models, observational reanalyses (HadISST) and multi-model means from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) historical simulations, CMIP projections, and HighResMIP experiment. (b) Map of observed SST (1995â2014 climatology HadISST). (c) Historical SST changes from observations. (d) CMIP 2005â2100 SST change rate. (e) Bias of CMIP. (f) CMIP change rate. (g) 2005â2050 change rate for SSP5-8.5 for the CMIP ensemble. (h) Bias of HighResMIP (bottom left) over 1995â2014. (i) HighResMIP change rate for 1950â2014. (j) 2005â2050 change rate for SSP5-8.5 for the HighResMIP ensemble. No overlay indicates regions with high model agreement, where â¥80% of models agree on sign of change. Diagonal lines indicate regions with low model agreement, where <80% of models agree on sign of change (see Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 for more information). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 9.SM.9).

# 

# ## **Summary**
# 
# In the final tutorial of the day, we learned about the importance of synthesizing CMIP6 model data (future projections and historical simulations), alongside modern climate and palroclimate observations. This synthesis provides validation of CMIP6 simulation data, and it provides historical context for recent and projected rapid changes in Earth's climate, as many of these changes are unprecedented in human-recored history.
# 
# In the upcoming tutorials, we will shift our focus towards the socio-economic aspects of future climate change. This exploration will take various forms, including the design of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) we began using today. We'll contemplate the realism of different socio-economic future scenarios and examine their potential impacts on future climate forcings. Moreover, we'll delve into how a changing climate might affect society. As we proceed with the next tutorials, keep in mind the intricate connection between physical and socio-economic changes.
