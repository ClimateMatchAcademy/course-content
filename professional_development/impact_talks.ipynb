    "These interviews with practitioners in the field are designed to spark reflections and discussions among students about important topics that may not always be on the forefront of everyone's mind when thinking about Climate Science and Climate Change. "

    "    * One student/leader will be tasked with leading the discussion \"from the front\" by \n",
    "        (1) reading out loud and putting on the chat the prompt being addressed, \n",
    "        (2) answering discussion prompts at first until the group warms up and others wish to answer or offer thoughts first, and \n",
    "        (3) encouraging everyone in the group to participate in the best way that suits each person(*). \n",
    "    * One student/leader will be tasked with leading the discussion \"from behind\" by \n",

    "        (3) keeping track of time (**).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember that not everyone wishes to contribute to discussions in the same manner. Not all may wish to speak, but we want to provide space such that all have the opportunity to participate as they wish. Consider giving a few minutes to answer prompts individually and then share. Some may wish to draw or text instead of speaking, etc. and ideally both assigned leaders in the group can foster all kinds of participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will have 30 minutes to both watch the video and start engaging in discussion; at least one assigned leader will keep track of time. This doesn’t mean all the prompts will be answered, but rather they can all get group and individual reflections started.\n",

She shares her view and definition of “equity” and how it plays a role in her career, professional work and generally in the things she does. She shares about an initiative she leads called “Climatewiki”, which is an incredible platform used to share in Spanish about the impact of climate change, in particular from the latinamerican lens. Additionally, Juliana shares inequities she has found as a climate scientists, steps she hs takin to address this, and how we might take positive action to support communities that have been impacted negatively by bad/inequitable practices such as harassment, sexual harassment, and others that happen in climate science. Lastly, Juliana shares some takeaways and what you could do to support equity in climate science and/or climate solutions from an equity lens.\n",
