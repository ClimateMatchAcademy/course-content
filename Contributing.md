# Workflow

The general Workflow goes as follows:
1. Request being added to [ClimateMatchAcademy](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMatchAcademy/teams) and [Content Creators](https://github.com/orgs/ClimateMatchAcademy/teams/content-creators)
1. Create a branch for your work in [Course Content](https://github.com/ClimateMatchAcademy/course-content)
1. Carry out your work
1. Create a Pull request for your branch and request review
1. Upon Review your work will be merged into the main branch
