# Climatematch Impact Scholars program

Two weeks is a very short period of time for scientific discovery! To take projects to the next level, Climatematch Academy, in collaboration with [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), will be able to provide selected student groups with computing resources for 5 months after the course ends as part of the **Climatematch Impact Scholars program**. Thanks to our partnership with [Fresh Eyes on CMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/fresh-eyes-on-cmip/), student groups will also have an opportunity to showcase their work to, and get feedback from, experienced researchers working on similar questions. 


## **Eligibility**

**Each project group can submit one application**. Groups can be of any size. We understand that not every member of a group will be able to dedicate time to the project after the course. Any eventual publication should acknowledge all contributions made during or after the course.

**Teaching Assistants are welcome to join teams as equal collaborators**. They can join as many of their groups as they would be able to contribute to in case the applications are successful.

## **Application process**
### 1. Expression of interest 
**July 27, 2023** (slots 2,5) / **July 28, 2023** (slots 1,3,4) 

Upon submission of your project slides at the end of Day 9, we ask that you indicate the number of people from your team who are planning to apply for extended computing resources to continue the project. We also ask whether either or both of your Teaching Assistants are interested in joining you, so please discuss this with them before submitting the form!

You will have access to computing resources until the application deadline so that you can ground your project proposal in solid preliminary analysis.


###  2. Application deadline
**August 31, 2023** 

To apply for extended resources, **submit a detailed project proposal** by the deadline. The application form will be posted here soon!

The strongest proposals will:

* directly build on, and be supported by, analyses conducted during the course and the following month; 
* have a clear research focus;
* connect the climate phenomenon of interest to its socio-economic impact.

###  3. Application decisions
Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. We will aim to get back to you within two weeks of proposal submission.

## **What is involved**
Selected groups will be provided with continued access to computing resources **until December 31, 2023**, and invited to present their work at a *Fresh Eyes on CMIP* workshop.


We are actively working on providing you with more professional and academic opportunities. Stay tuned!
