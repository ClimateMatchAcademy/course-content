# Career Features


* **_Why_**: There is no fixed career pathways for everyone. Career features are tailored to **showcase a range of professionals** working to support action to address our current climate crisis, and that may inspire students for their own career exploration.
* **_What_**: **Online write-ups** of practitioners in climate and related fields that are part of the program book during the program. These career features may include mentors, impact speakers, career panelists, and other volunteers in CMA.
* **_How_**: Students are encouraged to **browse career features** that interest them **at their own pace**, and follow up with practitioners if they want to learn more about different career pathways.
