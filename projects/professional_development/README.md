# Professional Development

Professional development encompasses four different activities: Impact Talks, Mentor Meetings, Career Features and Career Panels. Use this guide to find out more about each activity and when and how to attend them!

## Why Professional Development?

Professional development enables students to connect and expand their experiences, skills and interest, broadening students’ perception of how they can make an impact via different career options. 

Specifically, students will:

* Watch recorded interviews on selected topics, relevant to a more just climate science
* Reflect and share how they and their work may relate to those selected topics
* Expand their views about career pathways via live panel discussions with professionals in climate-related fields
* Meet with mentors with different career backgrounds
* Expand their views about making impact by browsing different career profiles
