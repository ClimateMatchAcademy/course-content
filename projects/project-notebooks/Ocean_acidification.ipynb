    "\n",
    "This data package contains a hybrid surface OA data product that is produced based on three recent observational data products: (a) the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT, version 2022), (b) the Global Ocean Data Analysis Product version 2 (GLODAPv2, version 2022), and (c) the Coastal Ocean Data Analysis Product in North America (CODAP-NA, version 2021), and 14 Earth System Models from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The trajectories of ten OA indicators, including fugacity of carbon dioxide, pH on Total Scale, total hydrogen ion content, free hydrogen ion content, carbonate ion content, aragonite saturation state, calcite saturation state, Revelle Factor, total dissolved inorganic carbon content, and total alkalinity content are provided under preindustrial conditions, historical conditions, and future Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: SSP1-19, SSP1-26, SSP2-45, SSP3-70, and SSP5-85 from 1750 to 2100 on a global surface ocean grid. These OA trajectories are improved relative to previous OA data products with respect to data quantity, spatial and temporal coverage, diversity of the underlying data and model simulations, and the provided SSPs over the 21st century.\n",

    "\n",
    "From this dataset we will use **CO<sub>2</sub> column-mean molar fraction** from the Single-level chemical vertical integrals variables & **Sea Surface Temperature** from the Single-level meteorological variables (in case you need to download them direclty from the catalog). \n",

    "This dataset is part of the [ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis focusing on long-lived greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data/copernicus-services-catalogue/cams-global-ghg-reanalysis-egg4-monthly). The emissions and natural fluxes at the surface are crucial for the evolution of the long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this dataset the CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes from terrestrial vegetation are modelled in order to simulate the variability across a wide range of scales from diurnal to inter-annual. The CH<sub>4</sub> chemical loss is represented by a climatological loss rate and the emissions at the surface are taken from a range of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n",
