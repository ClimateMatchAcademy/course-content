We encourage you to investigate the relationships between these variables and their impact on the global radiative budget. Moreover, you can track agricultural land abandonment and analyze its potential connection to climate change. This project aligns well with the topics covered in W2D3, which you are encouraged to explore further."

    "\n",
    "MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is a key instrument aboard the Terra (originally known as EOS AM-1) and Aqua (originally known as EOS PM-1) satellites. Terra's orbit around the Earth is timed so that it passes from north to south across the equator in the morning, while Aqua passes south to north over the equator in the afternoon. Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS are viewing the entire Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral bands, or groups of wavelengths (see MODIS Technical Specifications). These data will improve your understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere. MODIS plays a vital role in the development of validated, global, interactive Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough to assist policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the protection of our environment (https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/). The MCD12Q1.061 MODIS Land Cover Type Yearly Global 500m sinusoidal grid land cover data are available [here](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd12q1v061/) , and the  MOD17A3HGF.061 MODIS/Terra Net Primary Production Gap-Filled Yearly L4 Global 500m sinusoidal grid dataset is available [here](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod17a3hgfv061/).\n",

It is created by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis, which combines model data and global observations to generate a complete and reliable dataset using the laws of physics. \n",

The data used here is a post-processed subset of the complete ERA5-Land dataset. Monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated to facilitate quick and convenient access to the data, particularly for applications that do not require sub-monthly fields. The native spatial resolution of the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset is 9km on a reduced Gaussian grid (TCo1279). The data in the CDS has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.1x0.1 degrees.\n",

    "### To Calculate Albedo Using ERA5-Land\n",
    "ERA5 parameter [`Forecast albedo`](https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=243) provides is the measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. Values are between 0 and 1. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).\n"
