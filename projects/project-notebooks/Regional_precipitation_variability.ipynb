    "### Indices for Extreme Events\n",
    "The Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices ([ETCCDI]( http://etccdi.pacificclimate.org/list_27_indices.shtml)) has defined various indices that focus on different aspects such as duration or intensity of extreme events. The following functions provide examples of how to compute indices for each category. You can modify these functions to suit your specific needs or create your own custom functions. Here are some tips you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of the indices require daily data, so in order to select a specific season you can just use xarray to subset the data. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`daily_precip_DJF = data_chirps.sel(time=data_chirps['time.season']=='DJF')`\n",
    "\n",
    "- A common threshold for a wet event is precipitation greater than or equal to 1mm/day, while a dry (or non-precipitating) event is defined as precipitation less than 1mm/day.\n",
    "- Some of the indices are based on percentiles. You can define a base period climatology to calculate percentile thresholds, such as the 5th, 10th, 90th, and 95th percentiles, to determine extreme events."

    "As we learned in the W1D3 tutorials, all the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) datasets are available both at NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and commercial cloud platforms. See the link [here](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-cdr-terrestrial/). We are accessing the data directly via the [Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud storage space](https://noaa-cdr-ndvi-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project we recommend using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). It is one of the most commonly used remotely sensed indices. It measures the \"greeness\" of vegetation, and is useful in understanding vegetation density and assessing changes in plant health. For example, NDVI can be used to study the impacts of droughts, heatwaves, and insect infestations on plants covering Earth's surface. A good overview of this index from this particular sensor can be accessed [here](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/nasapub/217/).\n",

    "The reasaon that we put `*` in the above directory is because we are not sure about what satellite platform this data is from and when the data was processed. The `*` is called a **wildcard**, and is used because we want *all* the files that contain our specific criteria, but do not want to have to specify all the other pieces of the filename we are not sure about yet. It should return all the data satisfying that initial criteria and you can refine further once you see what is available. Essentially, this first step helps to narrow down the data search.
