The emissions and natural fluxes at the surface are crucial for the evolution of the long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this dataset the CO2 fluxes from terrestrial vegetation are modelled in order to simulate the variability across a wide range of scales from diurnal to inter-annual. The CH4 chemical loss is represented by a climatological loss rate and the emissions at the surface are taken from a range of datasets.\n","\n","Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n","\n","**Source & further information:** https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-ghg-reanalysis-egg4-monthly?tab=overview\n"],"metadata":{"id":"k9F0UYYTv31x"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Some how the SSTyCO2_CAMS_Copernicus_data.nc datafile needs to be read!!!"],"metadata":{"id":"jHtIvkso4nxI"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["We can load and visualize the **sea surface temperature** and **CO2 concentration** as follows:"],"metadata":{"id":"OcwO6XpY3rOS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["with nc.Dataset('SSTyCO2_CAMS_Copernicus_data.nc', 'r') as nc_fid2:\n","   vnames2 = nc_fid2.variables.keys()\n","   print(vnames2)\n","   lat2 = nc_fid2['latitude'][:] # note here you need [:] after to extract the data\n","   lon2 = nc_fid2['longitude'][:]  \n","   time2=nc_fid['time']\n","   co2 = nc_fid2['tcco2'][:]\n","   sst = nc_fid2['sst'][:]\n"," \n","\n","   print(co2.shape, sst.shape, lat2.shape, lon2.shape, time2.shape)"],"metadata":{"id":"mw0cIM9i40Nq","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1683786627774,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":220,"user":{"displayName":"Zane Mitrevica","userId":"10190758862467767060"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":305},"outputId":"910196c0-93ba-49e5-fb15-3a21d0379617"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"FileNotFoundError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m                         Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-9-45cf7bcdfb71>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 1>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0;32mwith\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnc\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mDataset\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'SSTyCO2_CAMS_Copernicus_data.nc'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m'r'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mas\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnc_fid2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m    \u001b[0mvnames2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnc_fid2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mvariables\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mkeys\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m    \u001b[0mprint\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0mvnames2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m    \u001b[0mlat2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnc_fid2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'latitude'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m# note here you need [:] after to extract the data\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m    \u001b[0mlon2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mnc_fid2\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m'longitude'\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m[\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m]\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;32msrc/netCDF4/_netCDF4.pyx\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mnetCDF4._netCDF4.Dataset.__init__\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;32msrc/netCDF4/_netCDF4.pyx\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36mnetCDF4._netCDF4._ensure_nc_success\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'SSTyCO2_CAMS_Copernicus_data.nc'"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ds2 = xr.open_dataset('SSTyCO2_CAMS_Copernicus_data.nc')\n","ds2"],"metadata":{"id":"rF3Z4CwmwE1K"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Further reading**\n","\n","Missing"],"metadata":{"id":"e5KKmsTujjAg"}}]}
