1. 10, 40 and 70 mm/day.
2. Our data only spans from 1920 to 2022. If we are truly interested in 100-year events we need to work with a longer dataset perhaps using paleo proxies or other instrumentation. The longer the dataset, the more frequently we would expect to observe the long return period events and increase our confidence in them. Other ideas would be estimating probability/cumulative density functions (next few tutorials) or to use resampling methods (coding exercise below).
