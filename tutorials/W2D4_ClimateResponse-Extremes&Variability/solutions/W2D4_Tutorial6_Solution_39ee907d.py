1.  The changes over the historical period are relatively small, however there are larger return levels noted for the most recent climate normal from 1985-2014. One limitation is the length of time used, as the shape parameter is typically not well defined. Using a longer time interval and likely a better shape parameters could give us more confidence in our return level estimates.
