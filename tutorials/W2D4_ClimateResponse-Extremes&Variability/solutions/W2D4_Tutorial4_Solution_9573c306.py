Put your observations here. GEV distribution describes the data better than the normal distribution. However, they are similar for shorter return periods. This suggests that for common, less extreme events (short return periods), both the Normal and GEV distributions provide a similar representation of the data. This similarity is likely due to the fact that for less extreme events, the tail of the distribution (which captures extreme events) is less relevant. When we move toards longer return periods (which correspond to more extreme events), the two curves start to diverge.
