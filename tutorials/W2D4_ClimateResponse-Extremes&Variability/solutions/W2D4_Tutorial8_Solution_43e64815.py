1. There is a larger fraction of land area exposed to extreme temperature conditions the higher the emission scenario.

2. The choice of threshold here could certainly impact the results! The best way to know for sure is to try it out! While the threshold used here is physically grounded in studies, it is important to understand the sensitivity of this choice, especially when using models which are imperfect. One possible route to understanding the uncertainty more would be to use an ensemble of climate models, similar to those from the IPCC Physical Basis day.
