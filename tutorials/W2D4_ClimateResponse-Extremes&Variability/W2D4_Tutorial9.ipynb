When it is very hot, the body cools through sweat, that is evaporating water off the skin, which cools the body through \"latent heat loss\". This depends on the ability of the air to take up that water. This is why sweating is more efficient in dry heat, and why humid heat feels \"hotter\" - it is harder for the body to cool down.\n","\n","Consequently, the combination of temperature and humidity imposes limits on the body to regulate its temperature.

The climate model uses what we know about volcanic eruptions, greenhouse gas emission etc.\n","The SSP scenarios cover 'possible climate futures' after 2014. Therefore they are predictions (\"this is what we think will happen\") but projections (\"this is plausible given the assumptions\"). The different scenarios make different such assumptions, largely about the speed and ambition which which humanity addresses global warming and reduces the emission of the greenhouse gases and other pollutants. \n","2. SSP-126: This is an 'ambitious' climate scenario, with fast emission reductions, and consequently relatively low levels of global warming and climate impacts.\n","3. SSP-245: This is a 'medium' climate scenario that may be reasonably close to a \"best guess\" given the current policy trajectory and assuming political behavior continues like this.\n","4. SSP-585: This is the most extreme climate scenario considered by the IPCC, with strong economic growth fueled by greenhouse gas emissions. It has the strongest warming of all considered scenarios, and is thus often used as a 'worst-case scenario' (sometimes inappropriately). Many experts nowadays considere this scenario to be quite unlikely given the strong improvement in the ambition of mitigation policies in the last 10 years or so.\n","\n","In pre-processing, the data was averaged over 7-days and then the annual maximum was computed.
