The KNMI Climate Explorer is great resource to interactively work with both observational and climate model data, including extreme value analysis: https://climexp.knmi.nl/
 
For recent studies on if/how anthropogenic climate change contributed to a particular extreme event in the recent news, follow World Weather Attribution (https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/)
 
To access a large amount of climate data (in particular model data), including some computational resources for analysis, check out the Pangeo platform (which was one of the inspirations for Climatematch) at pangeo.io.
 
There is a wealth of recent literature on extreme events in climate, one of the most topical areas of climate change research of the past decade.
