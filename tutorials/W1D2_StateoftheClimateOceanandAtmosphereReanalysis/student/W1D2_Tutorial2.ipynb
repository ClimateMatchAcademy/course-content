    "In the previous section we learned about ENSO, which as an atmosphere-ocean dynamical phenomena. We will now examine the atmosphere and the ocean systems more generally. \n",
    "\n",
    " In this tutorial you will learn how to handle reanalysis data and how they derive weather and climate varaivles of interest. We will begin with two ways to access the ECMWF ERA5 renalysis, either through Poodac, or alternatively through the web copernicus api. You will learn how to pick and mask a region on interest, and see how important climate variables will change within on short timescales between days, months.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:\n",
    "- a) access and select reanalysis data of interest\n",
    "- b) plot variables so that you can see changes in on different time scales.\n",
    "- c) derive timeseries of these variables.\n",

    "## Introduction: What are Reanalysis data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that earth is warming. But how do we know that, and how do we know how that changes weather and climate? These are very hard questions, but thanks to work of many scientist, we now have data that allows to pick at any place of the planet and look how weather and cliamte has changes since 1979. This data is called **Reanalysis data**, and refers to the process of combining historical observations from a variety of sources, such as weather stations, satellites, and buoys, with numerical models to create a comprehensive and consistent record of past weather and climate conditions. Reanalysis data is then used to study the Earth's climate system over a wide range of time scales, from seasonal to decadal to century-scale changes. By providing a complete picture of the Earth's climate history, reanalysis data is great tool to understand the causes and effects of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This video](https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-reanalysis) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provides you with a brief introdution about their reanalysis, called **ERA5**. Note that there is not one reanalysis product that that fits all needs, such that there are many earth reanalysis like MERRA-2, NCEP-NCAR, JRA-55C, and many others [see extensive list here](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/atmospheric-reanalysis-overview-comparison-tables)"
