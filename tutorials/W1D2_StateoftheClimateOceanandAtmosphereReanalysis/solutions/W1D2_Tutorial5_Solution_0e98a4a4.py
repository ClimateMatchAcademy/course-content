1. When salinity rises, the water's capacity to contract in response to added salt (haline contraction coefficient) generally increases. Similarly, as temperature decreases, water's volume expansion due to heating (thermal expansion coefficient) generally decreases. These variations can significantly affect seawater density, creating pressure gradients that in turn influence the intensity and direction of ocean currents.
2. The surface water in this region has a larger density than the surface water surrounding it, making it relatively likely that this surface water will be dense enough to sink and mix with the waters below. Conversely, the same latitude in the Pacific is much less dense (due to fresher water) and there is no deep water formation that takes place here.
