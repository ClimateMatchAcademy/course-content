1. The high frequency variability can largely be attributed to the diurnal cycle, or the differences in solar radiation between night and day. This causes large variations in surface temperature, particularly over land and shallow water.
2. The low frequency variability can be attributed to synoptic patterns (e.g., weather) which can move cold or warm air around on timescales of days to weeks.
3. We do not have a long enough time series for ENSO to show up, but ENSO could indirectly affect this timeseries by changing weather patterns on shorter timescales.
