1. The 2-meter temperature is dominated by the diurnal cycle.
2. The surface pressure, which is usually associated with storms, is dominated by the synoptic scale.
3. The 10-meter wind speed shows influences from both the diurnal cycle and the synoptic scale.
4. The ocean surface temperature shows some sensitivity to the diurnal cycle but is dominated by longer timescale (>weeks) variations than the atmospheric variables.
