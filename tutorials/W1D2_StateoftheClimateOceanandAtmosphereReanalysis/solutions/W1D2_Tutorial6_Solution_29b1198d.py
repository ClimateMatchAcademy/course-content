1. The total heat gain is around 190 ZJ, while the upper layers have gained roughly 130 ZJ (above 700 m) and 35 ZJ (700-2000 m). This means the upper 2000 m contain (130+35)/190 = 87% of the ocean's heat gain, despite containing only ~50% of the ocean's water (see the volume plot you created in Section 1).
