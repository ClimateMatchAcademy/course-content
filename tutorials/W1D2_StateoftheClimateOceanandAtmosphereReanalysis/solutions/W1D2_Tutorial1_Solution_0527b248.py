1. Based on the monthly Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data from 2000 to 2014, it appears that both the El Niño and La Niña phases (exceed +/- 0.5 ˚C) occurred roughly 4 times each over this period.
2. The strongest El Niño occurred in 2012 and the strongest La Niña occurred in 2010. Both strongest events happened in more recent years.
3. El Niño and La Niña events are primarily driven by the interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere. Their strength is impacted by factors involved in ocean-atmosphere interactions such as ocean heat content, strength of trade winds, rainfall (as explained  in the video), causing one El Niño or La Niña event to be stronger than another.
