1. The Hadley Cell is the tropical region containing the easterlies (a.k.a. trade winds), and the Ferrel Cell is the mid-latitude region containing the westerlies.
2. Meridional winds are typically weaker and less variable than zonal winds. This is due to the general circulation of the atmosphere, which primarily moves air in the east-west direction rather than north-south.
