1. The continents influence the strength of the winds, and since the continents are so unevenly positioned on on the planet, the winds are weaker in the North then in the South. The strongest winds occur in the Southenr Ocean, where we have little land, and the winds must get very strong to create the same amount of drag as over the large land masses in the Northern Hemisphere.
