1. The atmospheric dataset has a higher output frequency than the oceanic dataset because of the different timescales on which the atmosphere and the ocean change significantly. The atmosphere has a lower heat capacity (i.e., thermal inertia) and density than the ocean. This means that the temperature and wind speed (which is related to momentum) of the atmosphere can change rapidly (over minutes to hours), while the ocean temperature and currents change more slowly.
2. The atmosphere plays a faster, more immediate role in the climate system than the ocean. It reacts quickly to heat and pressure differences, driving weather and synoptic features. The ocean, on the other hand, plays a longer-term role in the climate system and provides a buffering effect against rapid atmospheric changes.
