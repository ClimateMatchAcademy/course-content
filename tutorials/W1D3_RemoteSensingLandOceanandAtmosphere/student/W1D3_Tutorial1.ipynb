    "Remote sensing is the technique of getting information from a distance by definition. In our daily life, photography is a very common format of remote sensing. In Earth and environmental science, we often use sensors onboard satellites in the space or aircrafts in the sky to acquire information of interests, such as, agriculture, disaster response, air pollution. \n",

    "Many organizations, including government agencies (e.g., NASA, NOAA), private companies (e.g., Planet, Maxar), and universities, design and launch remote sensors on satellites and aircrafts to observe the natural and human environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Electromagnetic energy**, emitted or reflected by objects travels in the form of waves through the atmosphere and the vacuum of space. These waves have different wavelengths (the distance from wave crest to wave crest) and frequencies; a shorter wavelength means a higher frequency. Some, like radio, microwave, and infrared waves, have a longer wavelength, while others, such as ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays, have a much shorter wavelength. \n",
    "* Human vision can only see visible light which sits in the middle of that range of long to shortwave radiation.\n",

    "All components of the Earth system reflect, absorb, or transmit energy, the amount of which varies by wavelength. The energies reflected and transmitted by these components can be captured by carefully designed remote sensors and used to study them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "* Snow has a very high albedo and reflects up to 90% of incoming solar radiation at the visible light wavelengtt. That's why snow is often bright and white to human eyes. \n",
    "* In contrast, the ocean reflects only about 6% of incoming solar radiation and absorbs the rest. So it often looks dark but that can be affected by other property of the ocean (e.g., surface waves, phytoplankton, water quality). \n",
    "* Meanwhile, when the solar energy is absorbed, it is re-emitted, usually at longer wavelengths (e.g., infrared and thermal infrared). Hence, ocean often re-emits the absorbed solar energy as infrared radiation, which is used to monitor the temperature of ocean. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Low-Earth orbit (approximately 160 to 2,000 km above Earth): this is the typical orbit for many Earth-observing satellites, including polar-orbiting satellites (e.g., Terra, Aqua, CloudSat, CALOPSO, see the image below of a list of NASA's polar orbiting satellites). Polar orbiting satellites travel from pole to pole as Earth rotates. This enables sensors aboard the satellite to acquire data for the entire globe rapidly, including the polar regions.\n",

    "* Medium-Earth orbit (approximately 2,000 to 35,500 km above Earth): this type of orbit is often used by the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.  \n",
    "* High-Earth orbit (above 35,500 km above Earth): this type of orbit is often used by geostationary satellites which enables a satellite to maintain its position directly over the same place on Earth’s surface. For example, NOAA operates two geostationary satellites to provide observations of the west Hemisphere every five minutes and targetted observations of severe weathers every 30 seconds. \n",

    "##**Section 1.3: Resolutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolution plays a role in how data from a sensor can be used. Resolution can vary depending on the satellite’s orbit and sensor design. There are four types of resolution to consider for any dataset—radiometric, spatial, spectral, and temporal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial resolution** is defined as the area on Earth's surface represended by each pixel within a remotely sensed image. The smaller area a pixel represent usually indicate higher spatial resolution. The finer the resolution (the lower the number), the more detail you can see. In the image below, you can see the difference in pixelation between a 30 m/pixel image (left image), a 100 m/pixel image (center image), and a 300 m/pixel image (right image). (Image credit: NASA Earth Observatory).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2022-02/spatial_resolution.jpg?VersionId=CqYOXFpvK326WrJYS_34WAr8cIRuH9Mm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the spatial resolution of remotely sensed data will limit what type of applications the data can be used for. For example, it is probably not appropriate to use the right image above to map local roads but the left image may suit for such application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal resolution**, also often referred to revisiting frequency, is defined as the time it takes for a satellite to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area. This often depends on the orbit, the sensor’s characteristics, and how wide the sensor can see from the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For polar-orbiting satellite, temporal resolution can vary from 1 day to 16 days. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, spatial resolution ranging from 250 m/pixel to 1 km/pixel depending on wavelength) flying onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellite since 2000 has a temporal resolution of 1-2 days. On the other hand, Operational Land Imager (OLI, 30 meter/pixel spatial resolution) on Landsat-8, a satellite jointly operated by NASA/USGS, has a narrower swath width and a temporal resolution of 16 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For geostationary satellites, they match the rate at which Earth is rotating, hence remotely sensed data from geostationary orbit usually have the temporal resolution of sub-hourly. For instance, the current generation of geostationary satellites has the temporal resolution of 5-15 minutes, while earlier geostationary satellites has the temporal resolution of 0.5-3 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectral resolution** refers to the ability of a remote sensor to discern finer wavelengths, that is, having more and narrower bands. Imagining that you have a camera that can take pictures at the wavelenght of thermal infrared sensors and x-ray, that will allow you to see the objects in a much more details and different purposes. Typically, **multispectral** remote sensors have 3-10 spectral bands while **hyperspectral** sensors have hundreds of spectral bands that allow us to look at objects on Earth's in enhanced details. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) captures information in 224 spectral channels (see image below, credit: NASA JPL). The sensors allow us to seperate rock and mineral types, vegetation types, water quality, and other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample image of AVIRIS over a lake and evaporation pond.](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/imported/avcubebig.gif?VersionId=vB8vyHe0veiLvzKN37vSwnXUpe4WpOHa)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radiometric resolution** quantifies how much information is contained in each pixel, often expressed as the number of bits representing the energy recorded. Each bit records an exponent of power 2. For example, an 8 bit resolution is $2^8$, which indicates that the sensor has 256 potential digital values (0-255) to store information. The image below from NASA Earth Observatory demonstrate the impact of radiometric resolutions on the details that we can see from the remotely sensed data. \n",

    "\n",
    "As illustrated in the image above, the higher the radiometric resolution (right image), the more values are available to store information, providing better discrimination between even the slightest differences in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_**\"Why can't we have the sensor with the best resolution of all four categories?\"**_\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great question! Due to technology limitations, it is very difficulte to have the \"perfect sensor\". For example, if you want to have high spatial resolution, there are only very limited energy in an ara for that pixel. This means you will need longer exposure to capture enough energy to get meaningful information for an area. The longer exposure means that you won't be able to revisit the same place as frequent as you want. But we can use a constellation of satellites with the same sensors to reduce the gaps between revisits, such as European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite pairs.\n",
