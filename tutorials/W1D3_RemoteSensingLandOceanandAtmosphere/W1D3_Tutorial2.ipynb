In North America and Europe, for instance, there are numerous weather stations that have been operating for over a century, providing reliable long-term data.\n",

While some satellites like Terra and Aqua have exceeded their designed lifespan and continue to operate successfully for more than 20 years, **relying on a single satellite for climate monitoring and applications is exceedingly challenging**, if not impossible.\n",

Since the 1970s, dozens of satellites, including both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites, have been designed for weather and environmental monitoring. While not originally intended for climate studies, researchers have developed methods to merge data from various satellite platforms, enabling the creation of robust long-term time series of satellite data. Moreover, future satellite missions are being carefully designed to extend these data records further.\n",
