1. In the unweighted mean all the data contribute equally to the mean, but in the weighted mean the low-latitudes contribute most. One reason that the weighted mean could be higher than the unweighted mean would be if the equatorial region had higher anomalies than the poles. These would be counted less in the unweighted mean and more in the weighted mean.
