To determine the best remotely sensed data for your application, you'd want to look for datasets that closely align with your spatial, temporal, spectral, and radiometric resolution needs. For instance, if we want to monitor tree health, we might consider using the following datasets: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices; Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data; Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data; Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP).
