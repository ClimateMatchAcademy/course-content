1. Aside from the rainforested areas like the Amazon, southern Africa, and Indonesia the error on land is relatively low. Over the ocean the error seems to be concentrated in rain belts such as the Intertropical Convergence Zone you learned about on day 1 of this week, as well as over regions like the Gulf Stream area. The error of the ocean is generally higher than land.
2. This is a difficult question to answer. There are a number of things that affect the variability of preciptation estimate errors. This can include the rain regime (e.g. deep convection), the time of year, the terrain, and having observations to validate the data (which are more limited over the ocean) among other uncertainties.
