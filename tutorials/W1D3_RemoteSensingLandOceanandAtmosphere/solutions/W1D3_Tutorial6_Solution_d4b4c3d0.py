1. The index using the 1982-2011 reference period is always a little larger than the 1991-2020 reference period curve.
2. This means that the climatology values for the 1991-2020 reference period were larger than that of 1982-2011.
3. This can help remove long term trends (e.g. from warming) that can obscure the anomalies and ensures the anomaly is to the correct 'normal'.
