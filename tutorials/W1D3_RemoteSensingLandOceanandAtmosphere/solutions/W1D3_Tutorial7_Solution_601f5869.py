1. The low correlation between the La Ni単a phase as precipitation suggests that there is not a strong relationship between the two. However, the stronger and significant correlation between El Ni単o and precipitation anomalies suggests that there is a more robust relationship between the two. This is in keeping with our physical understanding of how atmospheric convection and therefore preciptiation are affected that we learned about in Day 2.
2. It does. In the time series, we note that when there are peaks in the ONI, indicating and El Ni単o phase, there are generally peaks in the precipication anomaly. However, for La Ni単a events, when there are troughs in the ONI data, there is much less agreement with the precipitation anomalies.
