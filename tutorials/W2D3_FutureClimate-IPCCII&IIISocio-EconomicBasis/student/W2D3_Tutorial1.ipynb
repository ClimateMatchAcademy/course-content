    "*   The important variables in a world model are similar to those of Integrated Assessment Models: capital, production, population, pollution etc. \n",

    "1.  `World3` is a instructive world model of the resource depletion and pollution problem. These problems are prior to climate change in that they encapsulate it, and understanding them helps us understand the socioeconomic forces at work in driving the emissions that are the source of the climate change problem.\n",

    "*   N.B. the model is not only wrong (i.e. missing many variables), but is a poor idealization, i.e. not necessarily even qualitatively predictive because it is missing some determining variables/model features (e.g. technology innovation/adaptation). It is thus almost certainly not predictive, but is still useful in starting to think about 'world systems' because it includes important relationships between some important natural and socio-economic variables that we will look at here. To be fair, one could also criticize IAMs for lacking important variables, as we will see in future tutorials."
