    "*   The important variables in a world model are similar to those of Integrated Assessment Models: capital, production, population, pollution etc. \n",
    "*   `World3` is a world model that was developed in the 1970s and doesn't have an explicit climate component (perhaps its developers were unaware of climate change at the time, as many were back then). \n",
    "*   `World3` does have a *pollution* variable that is driven by industrial activity, and this pollution negatively impacts food production and directly increases mortality rates via health effects.\n",
    "*   If we were developing `World3` today with our knowledge of human-driven climate change, we would add greenhouse gas emissions as a component of the pollution variable, which is the place in `World3` representing the damaging waste of our industrial activity.  \n",
    "*   The reason we are looking at `World3` here in this first tutorial, is that:\n",
    "1.  `World3` is a instructive world model of the resource depletion and pollution problem. These problems are prior to climate change in that they encapsulate it, and understanding them helps us understand the socioeconomic forces at work in driving the emissions that are the source of the climate change problem.\n",
    "2. World models provide an alternative modelling tradition not steeped in the neoclassical economics on which IAMs are based. This provides some diversity in perspective.\n",
    "*   N.B. the model is not only wrong (i.e. missing many variables), but is a poor idealization, i.e. not necessarily even qualitatively predictive because it is missing some determining variables/model features (e.g. technology innovation/adaptation). It is thus almost certainly not predictive, but is still useful in starting to think about 'world systems' because it includes important relationships between some important natural and socio-economic variables that we will look at here. To be fair, one could also criticize IAMs for lacking important variables, as we will see in future tutorials."
