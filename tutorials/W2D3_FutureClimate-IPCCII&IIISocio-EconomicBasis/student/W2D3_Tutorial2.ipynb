    "The Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) was the first prominent Integrated Assessment model, a class of models economists use to inform policy decisions.

    "### Brief description\n",
    "- The DICE is a fully aggregated (ie. non-spatial) model, but otherwise contains the essence of many key components of more complex IAMs. \n",
    "- Unlike World3 (from tutorial 1), the world models used in IAMs usually have *exogeneous* variables, ie. those that are set externally, in addition to fixed world system parameters. These exogeneous variables are assumed to be under our society's control. \n",
    "- IAMs come equipped with an objective function that returns how valuable is a projected future obtained from running the world model under a given climate policy defined by time series of these exogeneous variables. In this sense, the objective function is what defines \"good\" in \"good climate policy\". \n",
    "- The computation in an IAM is then optimization of this objective as a function of the time series of these exogeneous variables over some fixed time window. In DICE, these exogeneous parameters are the time-dependent mitigation (i.e. emissions reduction) rate $\\mu(t)$ limiting warming-caused damages, and a savings rate, $S(t)$, driving capital investment (discussed below). \n",
    "- The choices for the standard values of the parameters used in the DICE models have been critisized, and updated versions have been analyzed and proposed (Hansel et al. 2021). Here, we look at the standard DICE2016 version of the model."

    "Now, let's consider the case that there are populations of individuals of *different* types (e.g. different blocks of countries in the world economy). In a centralized planning setting, how do we value the utilities of each relative to each other? Consider the following family of *social welfare functions* (*social* is used here simply because there is more than 1) that combine the utilities of $N$ groups (assuming these are discounted returns as computed above), $$W(U_1,\\dots, U_N)=\\sum_{i=1}^N U^\\beta_i$$ The choice of exponent parameter $\\beta$ specifies the kind of welfare function. The socalled utilitarian choice is to set $\\beta=1$, such that it is a sum that gives equal weight to each group. Alternatively, $\\beta<1$ is a case analogous to how we transformed consumption to utility above ($\\beta$ analogoues to $1-\\alpha$) in a way that overweighs lower consumption. Here this means prioritizing groups having lower utility so it's called the prioritarian choice (studied in the context of climate policy by Adler et al. *Nat. Clim. Change* (2017)). Fairness excludes all cases of $\\beta>1$. Note that the case of $\\beta$ near 0 gives $$\\frac{W(U_1,\\dots, U_N)-N}{\\beta}=\\sum_{i=1}^N\\log U_i =\\log\\prod_{i=1}^{N}U_i.$$\n",
    "Both the logarithm, subtraction by $N$ and rescaling by $1/\\beta$ do not change the ordering of joint utilities induced by $W$. The result is then simply the product of utilities, called the Nash social welfare function. It is a natural fairness function and has many solution methods associated with it (see game theory literature)."

Savings increases investment and thus productivity, but the resulting higher production drives emissions, driving up temperature and resulting in damages that scale down production. Mitigation costs balance this latter effect such that there typically exists a non-trivial joint time series of $\\mu_t$ and $S_t$ that maximizes $V$. Because of the discount factor $\\gamma$, $V$ is only determined by the future sequence of consumption (non-invested production) a few multiples of the horizon, $1/(1-\\gamma)$ time steps into the future."
