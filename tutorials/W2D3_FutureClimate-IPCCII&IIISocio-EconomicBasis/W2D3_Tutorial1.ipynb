    "*   If we were developing `World3` today with our knowledge of human-driven climate change, we would add greenhouse gas emissions as a component of the pollution variable, which is the place in `World3` representing the damaging waste of our industrial activity.  \n",
    "*   The reason we are looking at `World3` here in this first tutorial, is that:\n",
    "1.  `World3` is a instructive world model of the resource depletion and pollution problem. These problems are prior to climate change in that they encapsulate it, and understanding them helps us understand the socioeconomic forces at work in driving the emissions that are the source of the climate change problem.\n",
    "2. World models provide an alternative modelling tradition not steeped in the neoclassical economics on which IAMs are based. This provides some diversity in perspective.\n",
    "*   N.B. the model in `World3` is not only wrong (i.e. missing many variables), but is a poor idealization, i.e. not necessarily even qualitatively predictive because it is missing some determining variables/model features (e.g. technology innovation/adaptation). It is thus almost certainly not predictive, but is still useful for thinking about 'world systems' because it includes important relationships between some important natural and socio-economic variables that we will look at here and also see later when we study IAMs. To be fair, IAMs deserve similar criticism (e.g. for lacking important variables), as we will see in future tutorials."
