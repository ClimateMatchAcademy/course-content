    "The Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) was the first prominent Integrated Assessment model, a class of models economists use to inform policy decisions. Like world3, it's too idealized to be predictive. DICE is still useful as a sandbox for climate policy ideas (though even in that it could be improved! c.f.  https://www3.nd.edu/~nmark/Climate/DICE-simplified_2019.pdf), which is how we will use it here.\n",

    "### Brief description\n",
    "- The DICE is a fully aggregated (ie. non-spatial) model, but otherwise contains the essence of many key components of more complex IAMs. \n",
    "- Unlike World3 (from tutorial 1), the world models used in IAMs usually have *exogeneous* variables, ie. those that are set externally, in addition to fixed world system parameters. These exogeneous variables are assumed to be under our society's control. \n",
    "- IAMs come equipped with an objective function that returns how valuable is a projected future obtained from running the world model under a given climate policy defined by time series of these exogeneous variables. In this sense, the objective function is what defines \"good\" in \"good climate policy\". \n",
    "- The computation in an IAM is then optimization of this objective as a function of the time series of these exogeneous variables over some fixed time window. In DICE, these exogeneous parameters are the time-dependent mitigation (i.e. emissions reduction) rate $\\mu(t)$ limiting warming-caused damages, and a savings rate, $S(t)$, driving capital investment (discussed below). \n",
    "- The choices for the standard values of the parameters used in the DICE models have been critisized, and updated versions have been analyzed and proposed (Hansel et al. 2021). Here, we look at the standard DICE2016 version of the model."

Mitigation costs balance this latter effect such that there typically exists a non-trivial joint time series of $\\mu_t$ and $S_t$ that maximizes $V$.

    "Local energy use varies with local temperature. Early work used an IAM to argue that climate change would actually lead to a net savings in energy expentidure as colder regions become warmer and require less energy for heating. Does that result of economic benefit pass your smell test? Savings for who? Those in cooler climates! Those in warmer climates would certainly suffer, but they don't use as much energy so their welfare wasn't affecting this calculation. Perhaps we should weight averting suffering over energy savings? \n",

    "A regional version of the DICE model is called the RICE model. There are nice python implementations of these, e.g. the RICE-N model https://github.com/mila-iqia/climate-cooperation-competition. In that competition they use a utilitarian social welare function. Alternatively, a prioritarian social welfare function would transform the utilities before summing such that increases from lower utility are valued more than those from higher utility (*c.f.* Adler et al. *Nat. Clim. Change* (2017)). What would varying the elasticity of this social welfare function do?"
