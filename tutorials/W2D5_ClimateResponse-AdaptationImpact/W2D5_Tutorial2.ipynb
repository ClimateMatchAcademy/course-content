    "In this tutorial, we will explore a dataset that relates weather variables to dengue fever cases. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the data into pandas dataframes and visualize it to see obvious trends.\n",
    "- Apply linear regression to the Dengue dataset: clean the data, implement linear regression using scikit-learn, and evaluate its performance. This will include handling categorical data using dummy variables and using scikit-learn's Poisson GLM method to handle integer-valued data.\n",
    "- Apply additional methods to the Dengue Fever dataset, including implementing Random Forest Regression, discussing and analyzing its performance, and measuring feature importance.\n",

Referencing the data exploration figures from the first section, we see that most of the data falls at or below 50 cases per week. This type of model does not excel at predicting extreme cases, and this is reflected on the plot above. Additionally, note the negative values (up to -10 cases per week) predicted by our model. It is of course not possible to have negative case numbers, however you can see that the linear regression equation does not prevent negative numbers. Later on in the bonus section you will look at a model more suitable for our dataset type that also guarantees non-negative results.\n",

Therefore, plain linear regression is not actually the most appropriate approach for this data. Rather, we should use a generalized linear model, or GLM, which is like linear regression, but includes an extra step that makes it more suited to handle Poisson data and prevent negative case numbers. Try to use [scikit-learn's Poisson GLM method](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.PoissonRegressor.html) on this data.

    "In this tutorial, you explored various methods of analyzing the Dengue Fever dataset from a climate science perspective. You started by using pandas to handle the data and visualizing trends and anomalies. Next, you applied linear regression to model the data and handle categorical and integer-valued data. Finally, you applied random forest regression to improve the performance of the model and learned about feature importance. Overall, learners gained practical experience in using different modeling techniques to analyze and make predictions about real-world climate data. \n",
