1. The random forest model generally performs better than the linear regression model as it can capture non-linear relationships between features and target.
2. The low performance of the model on the test set might be due to the model learning the noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns.
3. Overfitting is the term for good training performance but poor test performance, where the model fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize to new data.
4. Solutions to handle overfitting include reducing model complexity, increasing dataset size, using regularization, or cross-validation. Ensemble models such as random forests also do inherently help control overfitting by averaging many different models
