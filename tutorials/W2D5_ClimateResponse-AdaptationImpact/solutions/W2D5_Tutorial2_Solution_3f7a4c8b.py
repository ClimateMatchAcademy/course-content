1. The plot above shows that the min_air_temp (minimum air temperature) has the highest importance score, followed by week of year and tdtr (diurnal temperature range). Warmer environments are more conducive to mosquito populations, and the week of year may be important due to the season.
2. Surprisingly, these results suggest that some of the precipitation variables were not very helpful. One variable that might be more relevant to mosquito populatoins is an esimate of standing water.
