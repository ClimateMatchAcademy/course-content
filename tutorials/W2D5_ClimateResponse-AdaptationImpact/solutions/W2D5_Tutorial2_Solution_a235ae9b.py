Possible discussion: In terms of a 1:1 truth versus prediction, both models still struggle to predict case numbers larger than 50. However R-squared values do increase, especially for the Poisson model, and there is a slight impact on the other error metrics. Note also, as mentioned, the Possion model does not predict negative case values.
