1. Unlike the previous estimate of importance, here week of year, temperature variables and precipitation and humidity are all important. This underpins the importance of using multiple methods for estimating feature importance.
2. The important features with the built-in method shown here agree likely more with expectations: hot and humid environments are both supportive of mosquito populations. Note: we have used the training data to evaluate feature importance (this is mandatory for the built-in method); different results may come from using the test data.
