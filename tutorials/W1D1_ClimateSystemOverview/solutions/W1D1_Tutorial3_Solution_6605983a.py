1. About 1000 hPa.
2. Temperature decreases with increasing altitude primarily as a result of the decreasing air pressure, as dictated by the ideal gas law and the adiabatic cooling effect. According to the ideal gas law, which states that the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature when the volume and the amount of gas stay the same, the decrease in air pressure at higher altitudes leads to a decrease in temperature. Additionally, as air rises, it expands due to the decrease in pressure, resulting in a drop in temperature due to reduced kinetic energy of the air molecules.
