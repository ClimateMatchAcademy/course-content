1.  Upwelling is a process in which deep, cold water rises toward the surface. This can be identified in a sea surface temperature (SST) map as areas where the SST is colder than the surrounding waters. We note off the west coast of South America there is a 'tongue' of colder water from about -40 S northward. The strength of upwelling can often vary seasonally, and thus in our annual mean SST map above, the effects of this are likely more subtle.
