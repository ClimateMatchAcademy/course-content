1. In general, by examining the data at these different time scales, you can get a more comprehensive understanding of the SST variations and their potential causes.
2. The original monthly data gives you the most granular view of the data, allowing you to see monthly variations in SST. Coarsening the data over 4-month periods reduces the temporal resolution but provides a slightly smoothed series that could help identify patterns or trends over this larger time period. A 6-month moving average could be useful for identifying semi-annual trends and reducing the impact of short-term noise in the data. The annually resampled (12 months) data provides a high-level view of the SST data, emphasizing the annual pattern. This can be useful for identifying long-term trends or changes in the data over the span of years.
