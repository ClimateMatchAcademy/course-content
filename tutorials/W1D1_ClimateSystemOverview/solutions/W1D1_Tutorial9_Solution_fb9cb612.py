1. The SST time series indicates an increase from 2000 to 2014 for the Ni√±o 3.4 region. On top of this increase we see fluctuations seasonally and interannually (year-to year).
2. The seasonal variability could be related to seasonally varying insolation, overlying wind patterns, and precipitation, while the interannual variability could be tied to ENSO events.  The long-term trend of increasing SSTs could be attributed to human-induced global warming or decadal variability as our time series is quite short.
3. In the equatorial region, the grid cells are usually very similar in size. You could compute the weighted average and compare to be sure this is the case with our reanalysis product.

These questions are just to get you thinking....note from this time series alone we can not attribute processes to the observed SST.
