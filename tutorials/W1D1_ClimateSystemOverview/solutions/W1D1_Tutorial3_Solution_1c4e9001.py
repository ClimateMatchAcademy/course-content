1. In general, we would expect temperatures at the 500 hPa level (which is higher in the atmosphere) to be cooler than temperatures at the 1000 hPa level. The spatial differences in temperature seen in the map could be caused by a variety of factors, including solar radiation received at different latitudes, atmospheric circulation patterns, elevation difference, geographical features like mountains and bodies of water, and human activity.
