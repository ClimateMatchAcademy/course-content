    "## **Tutorial 2 Objectives**\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we learned how to use Xarray to create DataArray and Dataset objects to help us organizing large climate datasets. Global climate datasets can be very large with multiple variables, so DataArrays and Datasets are very useful tools for organizing, comparing and interpreting such data. But what if we want to examing data from a specific time or location, rather than the entire global dataset? For example, we might want to compare the average incoming solar radiation in the tropics versus the poles to the average annual temperature in the tropics versus the poles to assess the effect of insolation on regional temperature. In order to carry-out such analyses, it’s useful to be able to extract and compare subsets of data from a larger global dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore multiple computational tools in Xarray that allow us to select data from a specific spatial and temporal range. In particular, we will practice using:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`.sel()`:** select data based on coordinate values or date\n",
    "*   **`.interp()`:** interpolate to any latitude/longitude location to extract data\n",
    "*   **`slice()`:** to select a range (or slice) along one or more coordinates, we can pass a Python slice object to `.sel()`\n"
