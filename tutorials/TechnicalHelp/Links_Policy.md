## Policies

### Coursework attendance policy

Students who participate in this course will gain a certificate of completion for the coursework. Students are allowed to miss two days if necessary and if they communicate that with their teaching assistant.  If there are exceptional circumstances that force a student to miss class for reasons completely beyond their control, such as severe illness, electricity blackouts, etc, they can request to get the certificate despite missing more than two days by filling out the attendance exemption form ([https://airtable.com/shr7CB9qLcIVejpUd](https://airtable.com/shr7CB9qLcIVejpUd)) **at least two days prior to the end of course**. Please note these requests may not be granted.

### Projects attendance policy

Projects are an integral part of the Neuromatch Academy experience. Students who participate in projects and miss no more than two days of projects work will gain a certificate of completion for the projects. 

If there are exceptional circumstances that make it difficult to attend the projects portion of the course, students can request to drop out of projects by filling out the project exemption form (). If their request is granted, the student can continue to attend the coursework sections and gain a coursework certificate if eligible (see above), but not participate in the projects work.

If the student participates in projects but misses more than two days due to exceptional circumstances, they can request to get the projects certificate anyway by filling out the attendance exemption form ([https://airtable.com/shr7CB9qLcIVejpUd](https://airtable.com/shr7CB9qLcIVejpUd)) **at least two days prior to the end of course**. Please note these requests may not be granted.

## Academy Accessibility Statement 

Climatematch Academy believes and respects that each student brings diverse life and learning experiences to the educational environment and that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to education. As such, our team at Climatematch Academy is firmly committed to supporting DEIJSA+ (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Justice, Sense of Belonging, Accessibility, +) values, inclusion, and equity-based practices. One of our main goals has been to create an accessible and inclusive educational system with infrastructure and practices in place to support students' needs. We want every student to feel valued and in charge of their experience, knowing we have built-in support systems for them.

Accordingly, we adhere to the following resources, guidelines, and policies to support access and accessibility: 

### Attendance
- Attendance flexibility to miss class for acceptable reasons, such as medical appointments, illness, electricity blackouts, bad internet connection, and personal well-being, among others.
- Drop out of projects if there are exceptional circumstances that make it difficult to attend the project's portion of the course.
- Accommodating students with special needs, disabilities, and neurodiversity while maintaining confidentiality about their specific circumstances. 

### Curriculum
- Open Access. All course materials are freely available to use, share, and view under a CC-BY license with a public repository available on GitHub.
- Use of “FAIR” research software in the sense of four foundational principles: being Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
- Seven options of group projects to try to fit as much as possible student personal interest.
- Encouraging collaborative learning in small groups within pods.
- Encourage peer programming, an approach where programmers can leverage each other's strengths, build upon shared knowledge, and produce better code solutions through close collaboration and constant feedback.

### Logistical
- Flexibility in background prerequisites for admission.
- Flexibility in due dates.
- Running the course in five different time slots in different time zones.
- Forming language pods.
- Estimate your course fees based on your region and the opportunity to get a fee waiver.

### Visual
- Colorblind-friendly palettes in the vast majority of our materials.

### Technical
- Set up a JupyterHub online where all datasets and code are ready to use, providing a solution that offers major compute resources independently of personal computer capacities.
- Set up the tutorials on Google Colab and Kaggle for low-bandwidth Internet connections.
- Recorded lectures with video subtitles and speed control options available on Youtube and BiliBili.
- Provide computing resources for five months after the course ends as part of the Climatematch Impact Scholars program.

We understand that despite the efforts, there is still a long way to go to achieve the dream of true democratization of climate science. Still, we remain firm in our objectives, recognizing our limitations.
