    "To explore the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature, you may want to make a scatter plot of the two variables, where the x-axis represents CO<sub>2</sub> and the y-axis represents temperature. Then you can see if a linear regression model fits the data well.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you aren't familiar with a linear regression model, it is simply a way of isolating a relationship between two variables (e.g. x and y). For example, each giraffe might have different running speeds. You might wonder if taller giraffes run faster than shorter ones. How do we describe the relationship between a giraffe's height and its running speed? A linear regression model will be able to provide us a mathematical equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`speed = a * height +  b`\n",
    "\n",
    "where a and b are the slope and intercept of the equation, respectively. Such an equation allows us to predict an unknown giraffe's running speed by simply plugging its height into the equation. Not all giraffes will fit the relationship and other factors might influence their speeds, such as health, diet, age, etc. However, because of its simplicity, linear regression models are usually first attempted by scientists to quantify the relationship between variables.\n",
