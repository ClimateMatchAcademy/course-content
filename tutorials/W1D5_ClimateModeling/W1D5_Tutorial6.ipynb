    "From the plot you just made, one of the largest differences between observations and the pure radiation model with all gases lies in the lower atmosphere, where the surface air temperature is 20 degrees too warm and the 200 hPa pressure surface is 40 degrees too cold.

    "\n",
    "Here **static** means not due to wind, and **unstable** means the atmosphere wants to adjust to a different state because the surface air is relatively light and wants to rise into upper layers of the atmosphere. As the air rises, it creates **convective turbulence** (similar to boiling water, where convective circulation is introduced from heating water from below). The rising air, and the resultant turbulence, mixes the atmospheric column. This mixing often occurs across the **troposphere**, which is roughly the lowest 10km of the atmosphere. Most of the weather we experience lies in the troposphere. \n",

    "When air rises [adiabatically](httphttps://forecast.weather.gov/glossary.php?word=adiabatics://), it expands and cools due to the lower pressure.  The *rate* of cooling depends on whether the air is saturated with water vapor. When rising air is unsaturated, it cools following the dry adiabats. If the air saturates, it cools at a lesser rate denoted by the moist adiabats (we did not have time to discuss these moisture effects in the mini-lecture). \n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "In this tutorial, you explored the concept of radiative-convective equilibrium, learning to implement a Python model using the `climlab` package. You learned the limitations of a pure radiation model and the necessity to include atmospheric dynamics such as convection. Through coupling a radiation model with a convective model, you have simulated a more realistic atmospheric temperature profile. Even though the model does not directly resolve the vertical motion during convection, it incorporates a parameterization to automatically account for mixing in statically unstable regions. By the end of the tutorial, you could comprehend how this model expands on the previous energy balance models from tutorials 1-4."
