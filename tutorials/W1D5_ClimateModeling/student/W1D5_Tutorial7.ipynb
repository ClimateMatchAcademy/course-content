    "Massive projects like CMIP6 can contain millions of datasets. For most practical applications we only need a subset of the data. To do this, we need to specify exactly which data sets we need. The naming conventions of CMIP6 data sets are standardized across all models and experiments, which allows us to load multiple related data sets with efficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to load a CMIP6 dataset the following information must be specified:\n",
    "1. ***variable_id***: The variable(s) of interest  \n",
    "   * in CMIP6 SST is called *tos*\n",
    "2. ***source_id***: The CMIP6 model(s) that we want data from \n",
    "3. ***table_id***: The origin system and output frequency desired of the variable(s) \n",
    "   * We use *Omon* - data from the ocean model at monthly resolution\n",
    "4. ***grid_id***: The grid that we want the data to be on\n",
    "   * We use *gn*  which is data on the model's *native* grid, some models also provide *gr* (*regridded* data) and other grid options\n",
    "5. ***experiment_id***: The CMIP6 experiments that we want to analyze\n",
    "   * We will load three experiments: *historical*, *ssp126* and *ssp585*. We'll discuss these more in the next few tutorials\n",
    "6. ***member_id***: this distinguishes simulations if the same model is run repeatedly for an experiment\n",

For each of these terms, there is an upwelling and downwelling component. This is because, for example, some of the downwelling shortwave radiation is reflected back upwards due to the surface albedo. Similarly, some upwelling longwave radiation from Earth is absorbed by the atmosphere and re-emitted back towards the surface. The net radiative flux is given as \n",

That is, positive indicates heat transport upwards and away from the surface.\n",

    "We will also be looking at latent and sensible heat. **[Sensible heat](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Sensible_heat)** is the heat transferred due to a temperature difference between touching materials, for example between the air and the land or ocean surface. In this case, if the surface air is warmer than the land/ocean then heat is transferred from the air to the land/ocean (which is a downward or negative sensible heat flux), with an opposite-direction transfer if the air was colder than the land/ocean.\n",

    "**[Latent heat](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Latent_heat)** is due to evaporation and condensation of water, as these phase changes absorb and release heat respectively.

    "In this tutorial, you learned to identify and access specific CMIP6 datasets, which is vital for handling the vast datasets generated by climate models.  You analyzed data from a CESM simulation, focusing on how shortwave/longwave radiation, sensible and latent heat, contribute to the surface energy budget. This tutorial also explored the *zonal-mean* surface energy budget, elucidating how different surface heat flux components vary with latitude due to physical differences in air-surface conditions across regions."
