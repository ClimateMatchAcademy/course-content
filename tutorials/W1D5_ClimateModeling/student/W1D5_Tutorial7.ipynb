For most practical applications we only need a subset of the data, which we can select by specifying exactly which data sets we need. The naming conventions of CMIP6 data sets are standardized across all models and experiments, which allows us to load multiple related data sets with efficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to load a CMIP6 dataset the following information must be specified:\n",
    "1. ***variable_id***: The variable(s) of interest  \n",
    "   * in CMIP6 SST is called *tos*\n",
    "2. ***source_id***: The CMIP6 model(s) that we want data from \n",
    "3. ***table_id***: The origin system and output frequency desired of the variable(s) \n",
    "   * We use *Omon* - data from the ocean model at monthly resolution\n",
    "4. ***grid_id***: The grid that we want the data to be on\n",
    "   * We use *gn*  which is data on the model's *native* grid, some models also provide *gr* (*regridded* data) and other grid options\n",
    "5. ***experiment_id***: The CMIP6 experiments that we want to analyze\n",
    "   * We will load three experiments: *historical*, *ssp126* and *ssp585*. We'll discuss these more in the next few tutorials\n",
    "6. ***member_id***: this distinguishes simulations if the same model is run repeatedly for an experiment\n",

In this case, if the surface air is warmer than the land/ocean then heat is transferred from the air to the land/ocean (which is a downward or negative sensible heat flux), with an opposite-direction transfer if the air was colder than the land/ocean.\n",

You analyzed data from a CESM simulation, focusing on how shortwave/longwave radiation, sensible and latent heat, contribute to the surface energy budget. This tutorial also explored the *zonal-mean* surface energy budget, elucidating how different surface heat flux components vary with latitude due to physical differences in air-surface conditions across regions."
