For each of these terms, there is an upwelling and downwelling component.

That is, positive indicates an heat transport away from the surface (upward).\n",

In this case, if the surface air is warmer than the land/ocean then heat is transferred from the air to the land/ocean (which is a downward or negative sensible heat flux), with an opposite-direction transfer if the air was colder than the land/ocean.\n",
