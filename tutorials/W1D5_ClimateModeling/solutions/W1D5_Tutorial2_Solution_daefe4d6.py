1. If the insolation does not vary, a low albedo implies that Earth is less reflective (e.g less cloud, snow or ice cover) and vice versa for high albedo.
2. Both. The reflected radiation is a function of land surface changes (e.g. glaciations and vegetation changes) and clouds (water vapor changes).  The radiation from the sun has also varied over time, which you will go into more detail in tutorial 4.
