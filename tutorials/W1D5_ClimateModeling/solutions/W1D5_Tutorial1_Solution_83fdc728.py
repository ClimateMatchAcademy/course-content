1. When tau is close to 1, it would mean a nearly transparant atmosphere, and most of the OLR reaches the top of the atmosphere. The equation simplifies to the original Stefan-Boltzmann law when tau is exactly equal to 1.
   When tau is close to zero, it means a very opaque atmosphere and almost no OLR makes it to the top of the atmosphere. Almost all the OLR is absorbed, and no radiation would leave Earth's atmosphere when tau is 0.
2. It implies that Earth's atmosphere is transparent to the sun's radiation. This is not exactly true, for example ozone interacts with ultraviolet light from the sun.
   However, Earth's atmosphere does absorb largely in the infrared.
3. Clouds, aerosols, and scattering just to name a few.
