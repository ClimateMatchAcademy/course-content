1. In nature, convection changes the temperature of the atmospheric column faster than radiative processes because convection involves quick movement of air (and heat) form one place to another. Our model takes this into account by having convective processes act instantaneously on unstablities due to unstable temperature profiles.
2. Next steps could include expanding in space (x,y,z) and including other processes (such as dynamics) and additional components of the climate system (ocean etc.). We'll talk about this more in Tutorial 7 where you will work with the Community Earth System Model (CESM).
