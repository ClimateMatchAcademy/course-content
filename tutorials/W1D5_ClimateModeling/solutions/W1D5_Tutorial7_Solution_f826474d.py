5. Even though both latitude bands span 90 degrees, the poles of the Earth (highest 45 degrees of each hemisphere) cover a much smaller area than the Equatorial regions (lower 45 degrees of each hemisphere). Since the energy being entering or leaving the Earth system is the flux multiplied by the area, and the lower latitude region (negative/downward heat flux) covers a much larger area than the high latitude regions, the planet would be expected to warm in this situation.
