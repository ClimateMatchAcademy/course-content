1. It is lower.
2. It means that for the same radiative forcing, our model's surface temperature was less affected by the CO2 change.
3. There are many things, but two important ones are climate feedbacks and physics, which we will add in over the next few tutorials. Our current model only contains one feedback, the 'Planck feedback' also known as a 'Planck temperature response'. This is principly because as we warm we emit more energy (see Planck's law from Tutorial 1).
