1. The tropics are warmed by shortwave radiation, which is balanced by cooling from latent heat (evaporation), longwave radiation (because the surface is warm) and a smaller sensible heat flux. There is a net negative imbalance, so other processes (e.g., lateral movement of heat) must transport surface heat away from the tropics.
2. In polar regions the shortwave incoming radiation and longwave outgoing radiation are the dominant balance in the Antarctic, while the Arctic also has a significant downward flux sensible heat (the atmosphere is typically warmer than the ice/ocean/land).
3. The intertropical convergence zone. This is region of significant cloud cover and precipitation created by surface air from both hemispheres converging near the Equator. This is also part of the reason the other fluxes also show dips near the Equator.
4. Longwave radiation is relatively symmetric. Some differences may be cause by hemispheric differences in relative land/ocean cover at each latitude. Sensible heat is quite symmetric at most latitudes (small changes due to surface type similar to the longwave radiation), but there is a significant negative sensible heat flux in the Arctic due to the combination of cold ice/ocean near the North pole, and relatively warm air (versus the Antarctic continent where air is consistently very cold)
