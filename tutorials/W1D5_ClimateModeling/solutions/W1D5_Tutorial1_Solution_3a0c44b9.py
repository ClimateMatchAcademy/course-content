1. The calculated emission temperature of approximately 255 K or -18.2 C is significantly lower than the actual global mean surface temperature of approximately 288 K or 15 C.
2. We would expect the corresponding outgoing longwave radiation to be higher than the observed 239 W/mÂ², according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
3. As the video explains, this simple model doesn't account for the atmospheric greenhouse effect due to greenhouse gases that absorb radiation at these wavelengths.
