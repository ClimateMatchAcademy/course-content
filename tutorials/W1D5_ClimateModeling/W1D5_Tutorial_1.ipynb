Using the blackbody radiation model, we assume that there is nothing that lies between Earth's surface and space that interacts with Earth's emitted radiation. From the initial lecture on the global energy budget we know this is not true. Earth has an atmosphere, and within it are many gases and that changes the picture of pure blackbody radiation we used before. The effect of these gases on radiation, called the **greenhouse effect**, is what warms earth to a habitable temperture.\n","\n","A first approach is to model the greenhouse effect on outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to space by adding a transmissivity coefficient. The **transmissivity coeficient (**$\\mathbf{\\tau}$**)** represents the fraction of the radiation emitted from Earth that actually makes it to space. This coefficient is a number that lies between 0 and 1, and represents the *effects* of all the greenhouse gases on radiation, rather than including them explicity in the model. This is called a **parametrization**, and it will be discussed in more detail in tomorrows lecture.\n","\n","Applying this to the original model for blackbody radiation, we find the modified model to be\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","OLR = \\tau \\sigma T^4\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","Using  $OLR = 239 W m^{-2}$ and $T = 288 K$, estimate $\\tau$."],"metadata":{"id":"6RZNoIAODldG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# define the Stefan-Boltzmann Constant, noting we are using 'e' for scientific notation\n","sigma = 5.67e-8 # W m^-2 K^-4\n","\n","# define the outgoing longwave radiation based on observations from the IPCC AR6 Figure 7.2\n","OLR = 239 # W m^-2\n","\n","# define the emission temperature based on observtions of global mean surface temperature\n","T = 288 # K\n","\n","# plug into equation\n","tau = (OLR/(sigma * T**4)) # unitless number between 0 and 1\n","\n","# display answer\n","print('Transmissivity Coefficient: ' ,tau)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"IDQ7gMHKDqTE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681268100163,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":22,"user":{"displayName":"Jenna Pearson","userId":"05648130581702734913"}},"outputId":"a087cc4e-4d46-4bcd-fa42-4ca83ad6f9ac"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Transmissivity Coefficient:  0.6126957827090973\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"oSMEYrPRKKWz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
