1. Based on the top maps, it looks like the Equator and low latitudes warm significantly, and the higher latitudes also warm. The northern hemisphere warms more than the southern hemisphere. These changes agree qualitatively with the "change map" (bottom left), although the change map makes it clear that the Arctic surface waters are warming faster than the rest of the planet and that the warming is not spatially uniform anywhere (in fact parts of the North Atlantic cool slightly!). The warming in the low latitudes and Southern hemisphere is still significant, and shows interesting spatial patterns.
2. There are various things you might notice. For example, the January maps show more warming in the Southern hemisphere than the July maps, consistent with the Southern hemisphere summer creating a warmer baseline and more potential for extreme heat. We also see warming in the Equatorial Pacific region for January, which was not present for July, which could be due different ENSO phases across the two months and the two years. A final example is that the North Atlantic shows even stronger cooling in January than in July, this is a common signal in many climate models. This cooling can result from melting ice sheets and glaciers creating colder, fresher surface water, which increases stratification. This can reduce the amount of deep convection in the North Atlantic region (by trapping fresh cold water at the surface),weakening the thermohaline circulation.
3. The metadata of the CMIP6 dataset we are using in the first two plots contains a long-name for the variable and its units, which are automatically used for the axis labels. When we perform a mathematical operation (subtraction) on the dataset to create a new DataArray, the long-name metadata is not transferred to the new array to avoid confusion in case the operation creates a new variable (that could also have different units). This leads to the plot using the variable name (tos) for the x-axis instead of the long name.
