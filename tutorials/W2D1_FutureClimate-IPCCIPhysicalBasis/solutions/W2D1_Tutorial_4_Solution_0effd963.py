1. Under both of these scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5), the projected warming of the climate is greater than the multi-model uncertainty.
2. The warming is greater for SSP5-8.5, but so is the multi-model uncertainty, so the relative size of physical changes and multi-model uncertainty is comparable across both scenarios.
3. The likely range includes the middle 66% of model results at a given time. For 5 models this means the ranges encompass the middle 3 models (i.e., they exclude the highest and lowest cvalued model at each time).
