1. For a regular latitude-longitude grid the plot should consist of straight lines from top to bottom, and straight lines from left to right, that are evenly spaced in each of those directions. The grid of TaiESM1 looks like a regular latitude-longitude grid in the Southern hemisphere, but is quite different in the Northern hemisphere, with the grid cells getting small (converging) at a "grid North pole" which is actually placed at ~75 degrees North and 40 degrees West. a large part of this "grid North pole" doesn't contain any grid points (the white hole).
2. On a regular latitude-longitude grid, the grid cells rapidly get very small as you approach the pole which causes numerical issues for ocean model. For example, the time step has to be reduced to physically capture the movement between the smallest cells, leading to many more computations required to evolve the model. This is not a problem for ocean models at the South Pole because the pole is on land! In the Northern hemisphere, it is common to move the "grid North pole" of ocean models to occur in a land region (e.g., Asian and/or North American continents), and sometimes there are poles in both these land masses!
