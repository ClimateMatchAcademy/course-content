1. Each of these models has slightly different physics, numerics, and discretization. During the Cliamte Modeling, day you showed that Earth's theoretical equilibrium temperature under fixed insolation changes as more details/complexity of the real Earth system are included. Similarly, the small differences between models result in each model having a slightly different equilibrium temperature for a given insolation, which also manifests in these long-term these simulations.
