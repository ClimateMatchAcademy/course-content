1. The models agree much better across this time period, particularly in the reference period and during the rapid warming phase projected in the near future.
2. There is variability at both ends of the scale, but the future (2080) period has more inter-model variability than the past (1850) period. This is likely because each of these models has a simulates a unique climate system, as we found in the last question, which leads to different responses to the rapid  changes in effective radiative forcing that are projected in the near future.
