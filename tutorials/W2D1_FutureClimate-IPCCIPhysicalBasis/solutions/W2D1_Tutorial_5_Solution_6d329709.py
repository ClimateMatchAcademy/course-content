1. The uncertainty of the single-model ensemble is much smaller than the uncertainty of the multi-model ensemble. The single-model ensemble variations are driven only by internal climate variability, whereas the multi-model ensemble includes inter-model differences (numerics, physics, discretization) in addition to internal climate variability. Comparing the two plots suggests that most of our uncertainty in future projections of global mean SST come from inter-model differences. Internal climate variability is a relatively small contributor to this uncertainty.
