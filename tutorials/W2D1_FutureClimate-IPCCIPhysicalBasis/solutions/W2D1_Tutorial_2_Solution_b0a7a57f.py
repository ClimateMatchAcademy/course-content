1. The plots show warming of the ocean surface under SSP1-2.6, and the even greater warming seen under SSP5-8.5. This is expected from the forcing, the emissions under both scenarios lead to an increase in radiative forcing later in the century (which warms the planet), with the highest radiative forcing and warming under the SSP5-8.5 scenario.
