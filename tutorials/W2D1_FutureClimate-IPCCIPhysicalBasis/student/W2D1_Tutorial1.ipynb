    "Many CMIP6 models use distinct spatial grids, we call this the model's *native grid*. If you want to compare spatial maps from different models/observations, e.g. plot a map averaged over several models or the bias of this map relative to observations, you must first ensure the data from all the models (and observations) is on the same spatial grid. This is where regridding becomes essential!\n",
    "\n",
    "> Regridding is applied lazily, but it is still taking time to compute *when* it is applied. So if you want to compare for example the mean over time of several models it is often much quicker to compute the mean in time over the native grid and then regrid the result of that, instead of regridding each timestep and then calculating the mean!"
