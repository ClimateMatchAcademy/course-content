    "## Assessing El Niño Variability Using Pyleoclim Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The paleoclimate proxy records we'll be using today are oxygen isotope records from corals. As we learned in the video, the oxygen isotopes of corals record changes in sea-surface temperature (SST). The two coral records we'll look at are from Palmyra Atoll and Line Islands, both of which are in the tropical central Pacific Ocean. The location of these corals makes them particularly useful for understanding past changes in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO is a recurring climate pattern involving changes in SST in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. On periods ranging from about three to seven years, the SST across a large swath of the tropical Pacific Ocean warm or cool by anywhere from 1°C to 3°C, compared to normal. As a result, ENSO has the ability to change the global atmospheric circulation, which in turn, influences temperature and precipitation across the globe. There are three phases of ENSO:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **El Niño:**  warmer than average SSTs in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This results in weakened east to west equatorial winds, reduced rainfall in the western troical Pacific and increased rainfall in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n",
    "2.  **La Niña:** cooler than average SSTs in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This results in stronger east to west equatorial winds, increased rainfall in the western troical Pacific and decreased rainfall in the eastern tropical Pacific.\n",
    "3.   **Neutral:**  Neither El Niño or La Niña. Often tropical Pacific SSTs are generally close to average and equatorial winds blow east to west across the tropical Pacific Ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze and visualize paleoclimate proxy time series, we will be using [Pyleoclim](https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is the same Python package we used in the previous tutorial. As a reminder, Pycleoclim is specifically designed for the analysis of paleoclimate data. The package is designed around object-oriented `Series`, which can be directly manipulated for plotting and time series-appropriate analysis and operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Series` object describes the fundamentals of a time series. To create a Pyleoclim `Series`, we first need to load the data set, and then specify values for its various properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `time`: Time values for the time series\n",
    "*   `value`: Paleo values for the time series\n",
    "*   `time_name` (optional): Name of the time vector, (e.g., 'Time', 'Age'). This is used to label the x-axis on plots\n",
    "*   `time_unit` (optional): The units of the time axis (e.g., 'years')\n",
    "*   `value_name` (optional): The name of the paleo variable (e.g., 'Temperature')\n",
    "*   `value_unit` (optional): The units of the paleo variable (e.g., 'deg C')\n",
    "*   `label` (optional): Name of the time series (e.g., 'Nino 3.4')\n",
    "*   `clean_ts` (optional): If True (default), remove NaNs and set an increasing time axis\n"
