    "\n",
    "A common task in paleoclimatology is to relate a proxy record (or several of them) to the particular forcing(s) that is thought to dominate that particular record (e.g., based on the proxy, location etc.). We've already spent some time in earlier tutorials learning about the influence of Earth's orbital configuration on glacial-interglacial cycles. In this tutorial, we'll assess the the climate forcings of monsoon intensity over the past 400,000 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the video that monsoons are seasonal changes in the direction of strongest wind and precipitation that are primarily driven by variations in seasonal insolation.\n",
    "*   **Summer (Northern Hemisphere)**: land is warmer than the ocean, so the winds blow towards the land, resulting in heavy rainfall over land.\n",
    "*   **Winter (Northern Hemisphere)**: land cooler than the ocean, so the winds blown away from the land, resulting in heavy rainfall over the ocean and decreased rainfall over land.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "On longer timescales, changes in insolation and the mean climate state can drive changes in monsoon intensity. To assess these long-term changes, we can analyze paleoclimate reconstructions from monsoon regions such as India, Southeast Asia or Africa.  δ<sup>18</sup>O records from speleothems in Chinese caves are broadly interpreted to reflect continental-scale monsoon circulations. \n",
    "In this notebook we'll plot and analyze a composite of three δ<sup>18</sup>O speleothem records from multiple caves in China (Sanbao, Hulu, and Dongge caves) from [Cheng et al. (2016)](https://hwww.nature.com/articles/nature18591). We will then assess the relationship between the climate signals recorded by the speleothem δ<sup>18</sup>O and solar insolation."

However, the pre-processed δ<sup>18</sup>O data that we're using in this tutorial was multipled by -1, so now a more positive/\"enriched\" value suggests warmer temepratures or increased rainfall.
