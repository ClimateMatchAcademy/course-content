1. There are cyclical variations in d18O with periods of warmer temperatures (larger d18O) and periods of cooler temperatures (smaller d18O). These temperature changes reflect the glacial-interglacial cycles.
2. It appears as if the amplitudes of the glacial-interglacial cycles increased over the past 1 million years. Specifically, the amplitude changes ~700,000 years ago.
3. It's difficult to determine the temporal frequency at which these glacial-interglacial cycles occur by just looking at the time series. We will explore a computational tool to more accurately determine the length of these cycles. By eye, you might note a ~100,000 year cycle however, among others that are harder to discern.
