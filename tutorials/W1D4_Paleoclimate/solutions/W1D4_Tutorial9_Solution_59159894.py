1. Although there was a global increase in temperature between the LGM to present, the magnitude of this warming (i.e., the temperature anomaly) varied with latitude. Generally, the high latitudes, particularly in the north experienced larger warming than the tropics.

2. This pattern is known as polar amplification, which is caused by a number of factors including changes in albedo as ice sheets melt, changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and changes in the distribution of solar insolation.
