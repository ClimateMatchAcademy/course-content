1. In general when there is a recorded ENSO event in the ONI, there is an agreement with the coral records.  During El Nino Phases captured by the ONI (where SSTs are anomolously warm) we typically see a more negative d18O and vice versa for La Nina events.
2. ENSO is an interannual occurence, happening every 2-7 years. Within the d18O records there are high frequency signals. One thing (among many) we could do is remove these by filtering. This would help resolve our dataset into something more comparable to what the ONI is tracking.
