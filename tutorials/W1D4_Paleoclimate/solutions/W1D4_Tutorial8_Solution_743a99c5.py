1. The model temperatures exhibit greater variability compared to the proxy records due to the significantly lower sampling frequency of the proxies.
2. Despite the differences in variability and temporal resolution, the overall temperature trends seen in the proxy record and GMST anomaly reconstructions from all PMIP3 simulations are similar. Overall, both the model and the proxy show relatively constant temperatures until ~1850 when temperature rapidly increases due to the influence of anthropogenic forcings, particularly the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations due to human activities.
