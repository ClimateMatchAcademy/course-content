1. The overall trends are similar. However, there is more variability in the original δD records than in the PC1 time series. This makes sense because the principal component analysis identifies a common signal between original δD reconstructions and therefore is inherently less variable.
2. The Gulf of Aden δD record is the most similar to the PC1 time series. The Lake Bosumtwi δD record is the least similar to the PC1 time series. This difference is particularly noticeable between 5,000-10,000 years ago.
3. The PC1 time series suggests a drier climate (more positive δD) in Africa over the past 20,000 years. Recall that 20,000 years ago was the last glacial period. African rainfall increased ~15,000 years ago during the deglacial transition. There is a short period of drying ~12,000 years ago, which corresponds to the timing of the Younger Dryas (a millennial-scale, Northern Hemisphere high-latitude cooling event). This is followed by an increase in rainfall associated with what is known as the African Humid Period (a period of wet, humid conditions in northern and equatorial Africa, driven by intensification of the African monsoon). Finally, there is a decrease in rainfall over the past ~8,000 years towards the present. Note: δD only records qualitative changes in rainfall (i.e., wetter or drier relative to another time period), and does not provide quantitative measurements of the amount of rainfall.
