1.In the span of the last 24,000 years, there has been a considerable shift in global temperatures, transitioning from the colder phase of the Last Glacial Maximum to the relatively warmer Holocene epoch we are currently experiencing. This transformation was not linear, with periods of rapid warming interspersed with intervals of relative stability or even temporary cooling.
2.The increase in temperature around 17,000 years ago was likely driven by a combination of climate forcings: obliquity and eccentricity, both affect the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.
