The absence of much signal at the 23,000 year scale in the wavelet spectrum suggests that the influence of precession on glacial-interglacial cycles is less significant during this time period. In other words, these glacial-interglacial cycles are not strongly modulated by the precession forcing, which typically occurs every 23,000 years.
