1. The proxy measurements for tree rings seem to be the most similar to each other, while there are notable differences in the other two archives.
2. By just looking at the temperature records from each proxy type, the reconstructions don't appear to record the same temperature patterns due to the intra-archive variability. However, more quantitative comparisons would help to clarify the similarities and differences between the temperature reconstructions based on the three proxy types.
3. The frequency at which we can obtain information between the proxies varies between archive type. As you learned in the video, for example, tree rings can provide seasonal information while speleothems provide at most annual information. The variability on those shorter timescales will likely correspond with temperature fluctuations on the same timescales.
