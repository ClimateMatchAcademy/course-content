1. The dominant spectral power for the insolation data is ~23,000 years, which is roughly the same signal observed in the spectral analysis of the speleothem d18O record.
2. The relationship between solar insolation and monsoon intensity can be explained by the fact that solar insolation affects the temperature gradients between land and sea. During the summer, if there's high solar insolation, the land warms up more than the sea, leading to lower pressure over the land. This low pressure attracts moisture-rich air from the sea, causing the monsoon. Therefore, changes in solar insolation caused by Earth's orbital cycles could influence the intensity of monsoons. Specifically, the 23,000 year signal in these records suggests that precession-driven changes in insolation was the dominant forcing of monsoon intensity.
