    "Over the next 45 minutes, you will be implementing a linear regression model as outlined in Step 5 on real-world CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature records we will be analyzing are both examples of paleoclimate data (for more information, refer back to Step 3). The CO<sub>2</sub> record (Bereiter et al., 2015) was generated by measureing the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in ancient air bubbles trapped inside ice from multiple ice cores retrieved from Antarctica. The temperature record (Shakun et al., 2015) is based on chemical analysis done on the shells of planktic foraminifera. The foraminifera shells were identified and picked from deep-sea sediments, and the temperature record combined multiple sea-surface temperature records from a range of sites globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we focusing on these two records specifically? The CO<sub>2</sub> record from Antarctic ice core is the gold standard of air CO<sub>2</sub> variabilility on glacial-interglacial time scales, and it has a temporal resolution unmatched by any other reconstruction methods. The temperature record comes from sediment cores all over the global ocean, and therefore is likely representative of the global surface ocean temperature variability. Polar air temperature records are also available from ice core studies, but such records may represent an exaggerated view of the global temperature because of polar amplification.\n",
