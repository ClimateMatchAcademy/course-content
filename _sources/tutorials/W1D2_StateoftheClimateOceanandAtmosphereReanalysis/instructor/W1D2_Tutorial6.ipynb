    "# **Tutorial Objectives**\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will explore the ocean's vast heat capacity, which has a significant impact on the climate system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean has a heat capacity that is approximately 1000 times greater than the entire atmosphere, due to the relatively large mass and specific heat capacity of water. This means that the ocean has a significant impact on Earth's thermal equilibrium state. *Ocean heat uptake* and *ocean carbon uptake* mitigates the effect of anthropogenic climate change by absorbing roughly 90% of the excess heat and 25% of human-emitted CO2. As you will see in this tutorial, ocean heat uptake largely occurs in the upper ocean as it is the region in contact with the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ocean's high heat capacity also facilitates meridional ocean heat transport from the equator to the poles, which acts in addition to the meridional *atmospheric* heat transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this tutorial, you will explore the spatial distribution of heat in the ocean and how the ocean's  heat content is changing over time. To do this, you will utilize the [Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO)](https://www.ecco-group.org/) dataset."

At first glance, this seems consistent with the zonal mean plot you plotted earlier in the tutorial, where the upper ocean tends to be warmer than deeper waters. However, in the integral equation above, $\\theta$ is not the only depth-dependent term. The global ocean area ($A$) also varies with depth, with the area of the global ocean decreasing with depth until only a few deep trenches contain water at the greatest ocean depths.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you have quantified the spatial patterns and temporal changes of the ocean's heat content. You showed that the upper layers of the ocean contain most of the ocean's heat content, due to their relatively large area (and hence volume) compared to the deepest ocean layers. These upper layers also experience a disproportionately large fraction of the ocean warming that has been observed in recent decades. You also found that heat content distribution varies by latitude and longitude, and is typically greater in the lower latitudes, and the ocean's heat gain over time is not uniformly distributed across different oceanic regions."
