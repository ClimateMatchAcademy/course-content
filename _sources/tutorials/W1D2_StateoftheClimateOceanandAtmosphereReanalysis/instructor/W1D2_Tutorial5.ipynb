    "In the previous tutorial, we discussed how the surface ocean's movement is driven by wind forcing. However, the ocean can also experience movement due to density differences. The large scale ocean movement driven by these density differences is known as the *thermohaline circulation*. The density of ocean water is influenced by temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline), and fluid motion occur in response to pressure gradients caused by these density variations.\n",

    "Upon comparing the two equations of state, we observe that they are generally similar, but certain differences arise. These differences stem from the nonlinearity of the equation of state, where the haline contraction coefficient and thermal expansion coefficient are not constant as assumed in our linear equation of state.\n",

    "Irrespective of the method used to calculate density, we notice the presence of horizontal density variations (gradients) at the ocean surface. For instance, seawater tends to be less dense in the subtropics and denser near the poles. These density differences play a crucial role in driving ocean currents, as we discussed in the slides.\n",

    "1. When salinity rises, the water's capacity to contract in response to added salt (haline contraction coefficient) generally increases. Similarly, as temperature decreases, water's volume expansion due to heating (thermal expansion coefficient) generally decreases. These variations can significantly affect seawater density, creating pressure gradients that in turn influence the intensity and direction of ocean currents.\n",
    "2. The surface water in this region has a larger density than the surface water surrounding it, making it relatively likely that this surface water will be dense enough to sink and mix with the waters below. Conversely, the same latitude in the Pacific is much less dense (due to fresher water) and there is no deep water formation that takes place here.\n",
