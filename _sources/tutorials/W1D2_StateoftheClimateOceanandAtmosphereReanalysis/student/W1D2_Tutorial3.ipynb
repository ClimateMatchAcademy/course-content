    "In the previous tutorial you examined atmospheric surface temperatures. Spatial variations in surface temperature created by uneven solar radiation (e.g., between the Equator and poles), are one of the main drivers of global-scale air movement. Other processes such as the Earth's rotation, storm tracks, and surface topography can also influence global wind patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the seasonal variations in surface winds.\n",
    "- Calculate seasonal climatologies and create global maps.\n",
    "- Compare statistics derived from these climatologies.\n",

    "## **Additional Reading: Extra-tropical Storms**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the wind speed figure, you can notice areas of strong winds over the Southern Ocean, North Pacific, and North Atlantic. These powerful winds are caused by weather systems known as extratropical storms or mid-latitude cyclones. These storms occur in the middle latitudes, between 30 and 60 degrees north or south of the equator. During winter, they are particularly strong over the Southern Ocean and the oceans in the Northern Hemisphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extratropical storms form when warm and cold air masses interact. They have a low-pressure center and produce winds that circulate counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. These storms can be intense, bringing strong winds, heavy rain, snow, and sleet. They often lead to problems like flooding, power outages, and disruptions in transportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of these storms depends on factors such as the temperature difference between air masses, the speed of the jet stream, and the amount of moisture in the air. If you want to learn more about extratropical storms, you can refer to basic meteorology and atmospheric dynamics resources, or you can explore online sources such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wikipedia: [Extratropical Cyclone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extratropical_cyclone)\n",
    "- Pressbooks: [Chapter 13 - Extratropical Cyclones](http://pressbooks-dev.oer.hawaii.edu/atmo/chapter/chapter-13-extratropical-cyclones/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although an individual storm may last only a few days and doesn't create significant ocean currents, the continuous winds and the occurrence of multiple storms over a year can influence the development of ocean currents. These currents are a response to the persistent wind patterns."
