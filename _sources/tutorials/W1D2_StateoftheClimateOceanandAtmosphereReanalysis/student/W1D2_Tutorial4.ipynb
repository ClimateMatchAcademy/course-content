    "You may notice that the surface currents (red) are typically not aligned with the wind direction (blue). In fact, the surface ocean currents flow at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the wind direction! \n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of [Coriolis force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force) and the friction between ocean layers causes the wind-driven currents to turn and weaken with depth, eventually dissapearing entirely at depth. The resulting current *profile* is called the **[Ekman Spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekman_spiral)**, and the depth over which the spiral is present is called the **Ekman layer**. While the shape of this spiral can vary in time and space, the depth-integrated transport of water within the Ekman layer is called [**Ekman transport**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekman_transport). Ekman transport is always *90 degrees to the right* of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere, and 90 degrees to the *left* of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere. Under certain wind patterns or near coastlines, Ekman transport can lead to **Ekman Pumping**, where water is upwelled or downwelled depending on the wind direction. This process is particularily important for coastal ecosystems that rely on this upwelling (which is often seasonal) to bring nutrient-rich waters near the surface. These nutrients fuel the growth of tiny marine plants that support the entire food chain, upon which coastal economies often rely. These tiny plants are also responsible for most of the oxygen we breathe!\n",
