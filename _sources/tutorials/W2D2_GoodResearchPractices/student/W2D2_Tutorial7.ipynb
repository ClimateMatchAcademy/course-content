    "In Step 6, we created plots displaying the global CO<sub>2</sub> levels and sea surface temperature data spanning the past 800 thousand years. Additionally, we attempted to fit both variables using a linear regression model. Nevertheless, it is crucial to bear in mind that correlation does not imply causation. The fact that global CO<sub>2</sub> and sea surface temperature appear to co-vary does not automatically imply that one variable directly causes changes in the other. To establish causation, it is imperative to gather multiple lines of evidence. This underscores the importance of literature review in Step 2, as it aids in identifying corroborating evidence in climate research."
