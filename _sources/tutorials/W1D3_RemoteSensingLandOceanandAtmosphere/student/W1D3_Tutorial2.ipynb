    "You have already seen some examples of how satellite remote sensing data can be used for climate research and applications. But are all satellite data \"created equal\" for these purposes? There are a lot of considerations that need to be taken into account when using satellite data to monitor the long-term change of different components of the Earth system. In this section you will explore some of these considerations. Many of these are outlines in the definition of a climate data record given below.\n",
    "\n",

    "In 2004, a committee convened by the US National Research Council defined a [***Climate Data Record (CDR)***](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/climate-data-records) is \"a time series of measurements of sufficient length, consistency and continuity to determine climate variability and change.\" Although there are no specific number to determine the \"sufficient length\", the typical climate length is considered to be at least 30 years. To achieve a stable, consistent, and reliable satellite CDR, we need to carefully calibrate the raw satellite data. \n"

    "\n",
    "When it comes to monitoring environmental and climate changes in a region using weather stations, we have confidence in the data quality due to regular inspections and maintenance of these stations and instruments. In North America and Europe, for instance, there are numerous weather stations that have been operating for over a century, providing reliable long-term data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a single satellite mission has a **designed operational lifespan of 5-8 years**, and over time, the sensors on these satellites can deteriorate. While some satellites like Terra and Aqua have exceeded their designed lifespan and continue to operate successfully for more than 20 years, **relying on a single satellite for climate monitoring and applications is exceedingly challenging**, if not impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we have a range of satellite platforms at our disposal that operate continuously and carry similar remote sensors, making it feasible to utilize multiple satellites together for climate-related purposes. Since the 1970s, dozens of satellites, including both polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites, have been designed for weather and environmental monitoring. While not originally intended for climate studies, researchers have developed methods to merge data from various satellite platforms, enabling the creation of robust long-term time series of satellite data. Moreover, future satellite missions are being carefully designed to extend these data records further.\n",
