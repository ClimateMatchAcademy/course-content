    "# **Section 1: From Climatology to Anomaly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon your knowledge of climatology from the last tutorial, you will now calculate the anomalies from this climatology. An **anomaly**, in the context of climate studies, represents a departure from standard climatological conditions. For example, if the normal January temperature of the city that you live in is 10 °C and the January temperature of this year is 15 °C. We usually say the temperature anomaly of January this year is 5 °C above normal/ the climatology. The anomaly is an essential tool in detecting changes in climate patterns and is frequently utilized in critical climate reports such as those generated by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate an anomaly, we first establish a reference period, usually a 30-year window, to define our climatology. In this process, it is crucial to use high-quality data and aggregate it to the desired spatial resolution and temporal frequency, such as weekly or monthly. The anomaly is then determined by subtracting this long-term average from a given observation, thus creating a useful metric for further climate analysis such as trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will employ the [CPCP monthly precipitation Climate Data Record (CDR)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPCPMON_3.2/summary) to compute a monthly anomaly time series. Furthermore, we will learn to calculate the rolling mean of the generated precipitation anomaly time series. This knowledge will be invaluable for our upcoming tutorial on climate variability."
