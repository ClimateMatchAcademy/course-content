    "\n",
    "Remote sensing is the technique of getting information from a distance (remotely). In daily life, photography is a very common format of remote sensing. In Earth and environmental science, sensors are often used on satellites in space or aircrafts in the sky to acquire information on topics such as agriculture, disaster response, and air pollution. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many organizations involved in this work, including government agencies like [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/), private companies like [Planet](https://www.planet.com/) and [Maxar](https://www.maxar.com/), and various universities. They design and launch remote sensors on satellites and aircraft to monitor natural and human environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "These remote sensors offer a unique perspective of Earth and enable data-informed decision making about our planet's present and future state.   For an example of the data these sensors can provide, this is the [Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)](https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/current-satellite-missions/currently-flying/joint-polar-satellite-system/visible-infrared-imaging) onboard the [Suomi-NPP satellite](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/main/index.html) launched in 2011.

    "\n",
    "The concept of the electromagnetic spectrum is at the core of remote sensing. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Electromagnetic energy**, radiated or reflected by objects, travels as waves through the atmosphere and the void of space. These waves exhibit different [wavelengths](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Wavelength) (the distance between successive wave crests) and [frequencies](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Frequency); a shorter wavelength corresponds to a higher frequency. Certain waves, like radio, microwave, and infrared, possess longer wavelengths, whereas others, such as ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays, possess much shorter wavelengths.\n",
    "* Humans can only perceive visible light, situated in the middle of the spectrum that spans from longwave to shortwave radiation.\n",
    "* Nonetheless, we can engineer sensors to capture all other forms of electromagnetic energy emitted or reflected by elements of the Earth system, enabling us to monitor and research the Earth system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every element of Earth's system—land, water, air, and life—interacts with energy differently, reflecting, absorbing, or transmitting varying amounts depending on the wavelength. These energy interactions can be captured by strategically designed remote sensors, allowing us to analyze and understand these components.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance,\n",
    "- Snow possesses a high albedo, reflecting up to 90% of incoming solar radiation in the visible light wavelength. This high reflectivity accounts for snow's bright, white appearance to the human eye.\n",
    "- Conversely, the ocean reflects only about 6% of incoming solar radiation, absorbing the remainder. This absorption makes the ocean appear darker, though its appearance can be influenced by other factors like surface waves, phytoplankton presence, and water quality.\n",
    "- When solar energy is absorbed, it is typically re-emitted at longer wavelengths, such as infrared and thermal infrared. Thus, the ocean commonly re-emits absorbed solar energy as infrared radiation, which is utilized to monitor ocean temperatures.\n",
    "These are processes we experience in our everyday life, even if we don't consciously recognize them. Have you ever wondered why most leaves are green, why the sky is blue, or why flowers come in such a variety of colors?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Satellites can occupy several types of orbits around Earth. The three common categories of orbits are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Low-Earth orbit** (approximately 160 to 2,000 km above Earth): This orbit is common for many Earth-observing satellites, including polar-orbiting satellites (e.g., [Terra](https://terra.nasa.gov/), [Aqua](https://aqua.nasa.gov/), [CloudSat](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/cloudsat), [CALIPSO](https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/)). As the name suggests, polar-orbiting satellites travel from pole to pole, allowing Earth to rotate beneath them. This movement enables the onboard sensors to rapidly collect data across the entire globe, inclusive of the polar regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Illustration of the A-train polar-orbiting satellites operated by NASA and partner organizations.](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/ContentFeature/OrbitsManeuver/images/atrain.jpg)  \n",
    "  Illustration of the A-train polar-orbiting satellites operated by NASA. (Credit: [NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/ContentFeature/OrbitsManeuver/images/atrain.jpg))\n",
    "* **Medium-Earth orbit** (approximately 2,000 to 35,500 km above Earth): this type of orbit is often used by the [Global Positioning System (GPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) satellites.  \n",
    "* **High-Earth orbit** (above 35,500 km above Earth): Satellites in this orbit are typically geostationary. They maintain a fixed position above a specific location on Earth's surface. NOAA, for instance, operates two geostationary satellites that provide observations of the western hemisphere every five minutes and targeted observations of severe weather events every 30 seconds.\n",

    "## **Section 1.3: Resolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolution plays a crucial role in determining how data from a sensor can be interpreted and utilized. This can vary depending on the design of the satellite's sensor and its orbit. Four types of resolution are important to consider for any dataset—radiometric, spatial, spectral, and temporal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial resolution** is defined as the area on Earth's surface represented by each pixel within a remotely sensed image. Typically, a pixel representing a smaller area indicates a higher spatial resolution. The *fine* the resolution (the smaller the numerical value), the *more* detail can be discerned. In the image below, you can observe the difference in pixelation between a higher resolution 30 m/pixel image (left image), a medium resolution 100 m/pixel image (center image), and a coarser resolution 300 m/pixel image (right image).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Different Spatial Resolution](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2022-02/spatial_resolution.jpg?VersionId=CqYOXFpvK326WrJYS_34WAr8cIRuH9Mm) |\n",
    "-\n",
    "\n",
    "(Credit: [NASA Earth Observatory](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2022-02/spatial_resolution.jpg?VersionId=CqYOXFpvK326WrJYS_34WAr8cIRuH9Mm))\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the spatial resolution of remotely sensed data imposes constraints on the types of applications for which the data can be utilized. For instance, it would likely be inappropriate to use the right image above to map local roads, whereas the left image might be suitable for such an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temporal resolution**, also frequently referred to as **revisiting frequency**, is the time it takes for a satellite to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area. This parameter often depends on the satellite's orbit, the characteristics of the sensor, and the sensor's field of view from space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For polar-orbiting satellites, temporal resolution can vary from 1 day to 16 days. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/), spatial resolution ranging from 250 m/pixel to 1 km/pixel depending on wavelength) flying onboard NASA's Terra and Aqua satellite since 2000 has a temporal resolution of 1-2 days. Conversely, the Operational Land Imager ([OLI](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellites/landsat-8/spacecraft-instruments/operational-land-imager/), with a spatial resolution of 30 meter/pixel is featured on Landsat-8, a satellite jointly operated by NASA/USGS that has a narrower swath width and temporal resolution of 16 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Geostationary satellites maintain pace with Earth's rotation, allowing them to provide sub-hourly temporal resolution for remotely sensed data. For instance, the latest generation of geostationary satellites offers a temporal resolution of 5-15 minutes, while their predecessors provided a resolution of 0.5-3 hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Spectral resolution** represents a sensor's capability to distinguish finer, or more and narrower, wavelengths. The more wavelengths a sensor can distinguish, the more information we can obtain and the more applications we can apply the data to. Typically, **multispectral** remote sensors feature 3-10 spectral bands, while **hyperspectral** sensors have hundreds of spectral bands, enabling us to scrutinize Earth's objects in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer ([AVIRIS](https://aviris.jpl.nasa.gov/)) shown below records data in 224 spectral channels. These sensors enable us to differentiate between various rock and mineral types, vegetation types, water quality, and other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample image of AVIRIS over a lake and evaporation pond.](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/imported/avcubebig.gif?VersionId=vB8vyHe0veiLvzKN37vSwnXUpe4WpOHa) |\n",

    "\n",
    "**Radiometric resolution**  quantifies the amount of information contained in each pixel and is often expressed as the number of bits representing the recorded energy. Each bit records an exponent of power 2. For instance, an 8-bit resolution equals $2^8$, implying that the sensor can utilize 256 potential digital values (0-255) to store information. The image below from NASA Earth Observatory illustrates how radiometric resolution affects the level of detail visible in remotely sensed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Illustration of the impact of radiometric resoultion on remotely sensed data.](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2022-02/radiometric_resolution.png?VersionId=SUfbvvyRgjUqC1C5CoB2Br52GvwKq9iZ) |\n",

    "\n",
    "As illustrated in the image above, the higher the radiometric resolution (right image), the more values are available to store information, providing better discrimination between even the slightest differences in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_**\"Why can't we have the sensor with the best resolution of all four categories?\"**_\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great question! Due to technology limitations, it is very difficult to have the \"perfect sensor\". If you're aiming for high spatial resolution, there's only a limited amount of energy in the area for that pixel. This implies that you'll need a longer exposure to capture enough energy to extract meaningful information from that area. The longer the exposure, the less frequently you can revisit the same place. However, we can overcome this issue by using a constellation of satellites equipped with identical sensors to minimize the gaps between revisits. An example of this approach is the Sentinel-2 satellite pairs used by the European Space Agency."
