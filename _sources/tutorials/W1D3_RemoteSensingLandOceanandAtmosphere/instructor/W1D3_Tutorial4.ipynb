    "# **Tutorial Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will explore the concept of a climatology, and learn how to leverage it using satellite precipitation data. You have already practiced how to calcuate a climatology using temperature data in the overview of the climate system day. That data spanned only 14 years, and typically you would want your data to span at least 30 years to calculate a climatology. Here you will use data spanning several decades to explore the seasonal cycle of precpitation at a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completing this tutorial, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comprehend the fundamentals of climatologies.\n",
    "- Compute a climatology utilizing long-term satellite precipitation data.\n",
    "- Create informative maps including features such as projections, coastlines, and other advanced plotting components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, you'll employ NOAA's monthly precipitation climate data records as the primary resource to demonstrate the process of calculating a long-term climatology for climate analysis. Specifically, you'll use the [Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Monthly Precipitation Climate Data Record (CDR)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/climate-data-records/precipitation-gpcp-monthly). As part of your investigation, you'll focus on a specific location, observing its data across the entire time duration covered by the GPCP monthly dataset."
