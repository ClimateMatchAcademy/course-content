    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore a dataset that relates weather variables to dengue fever cases. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the data into pandas dataframes and visualize it to see obvious trends.\n",
    "- Apply linear regression to the Dengue dataset: clean the data, implement linear regression using scikit-learn, and evaluate its performance. This will include handling categorical data using dummy variables and using scikit-learn's Poisson GLM method to handle integer-valued data.\n",
    "- Apply additional methods to the Dengue Fever dataset, including implementing Random Forest Regression, discussing and analyzing its performance, and measuring feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will provide you with practical experience in working with real-world datasets and implementing different regression techniques.\n"

Referencing the data exploration figures from the first section, we see that most of the data falls at or below 50 cases per week. This type of model does not excel at predicting extreme cases, and this is reflected on the plot above. Additionally, note the negative values (up to -10 cases per week) predicted by our model. It is of course not possible to have negative case numbers, however you can see that the linear regression equation does not prevent negative numbers.
