    "Our ANN model has better training performance but not better test performance than the linear regression model. As we saw previously, high training data performance but poor test data performance could be a sign of overfitting. Overfitting happens when a model has too many free parameters, which it uses to 'memorize' the relationships between inputs and outputs in the training set. In this way, what the model learns is too specific to the training data and won't be helpful on new data. \n",
