    "For a given feature in the model, the permutation method randomly shuffles the values of that feature and tests the performance of the network with these permuted values. The amount that the model performance decreases when the feature's values are permuted can provide an indication of how important it is. Sci-kit learn has a method that implements permutation importance. It outputs a normalized measure of how much the feature impacts performance. "
