    "# **Tutorial Objectives**\n",
    "During the first week of the course, you learned about types of climate data from measurements, proxies and models, and computational tools for assessing past, present and future climate variability recorded by this data. During day one of this week, you began to explore climate model data from Earth System Models (ESMs) simulations conducted for the recent Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that are presented in the report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes (IPCC). However, the dominant source of uncertainty in those projections arise from how human society responds: e.g. how our emissions reduction and renewable energy technologies develop, how coherent our global politics are, how our consumption grows etc. For these reasons, in addition to understanding the physical basis of the climate variations projected by these models, it's also important to assess the current and future socioeconomic impact of climate change and what aspects of human activity are driving emissions. This day's tutorials focus on the socioeconomic projections regarding the future of climate change and are centered around the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) framework used by the IPCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first tutorial, you will see how society can be represented by inter-related socio-economic variables and thier projections into the future. This tutorial will provide insights into the pressing socioeconomic issues related to climate change, such as resource scarcity, population dynamics, and the potential impacts of unchecked resource extraction. In particular, you will see some socioeconomic projections of the Integrated Assessment Modelling (IAM) used by the IPCC, and the influence of shared socio-economic pathways on these projections. In the bulk of the tutorial, you will use the `World3` model, a tool developed in the 1970s to analyze potential economic and population scenarios. You will use it to learn about nonlinear, coupled dynamics of various aggregated world system variables and how this model informs modern day climate challenges."

    "In this, and subsequent, tutorials, you will explore Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which are the standard class of models used to make climate change projections. IAMs couple a climate model to an economic model, allowing us to evaluate the two-way coupling between economic productivity and climate change severity. IAMs can also account for changes that result from mitigation efforts, which lessen anthropogenic emissions. In other words, IAMs are models that link human economic activity with climate change. \n",

    "In previous days, you have looked at climate model data for projections of sea surface temperature change under different SSPs. We saw that applying different greenhouse gas forcings to a climate model affects global temperature projections and also influences other parts of the climate system, such as precipitation. In this section, we will take a look at the modelled socio-economic impacts associated with such changes to the physical climate system.\n",

Recall that endogeneous variables determined by other variables in the model, rather than being given to the model. Therefore, world models are self-contained and simply run as a dynamical system: given an initial condition (a value for all variables) and the equations describing rates of change of the variables, they output the subsequent time series of these variables.

If we were developing `World3` today with our knowledge of human-driven climate change, we would add greenhouse gas emissions as a component of the pollution variable, which is the place in `World3` representing the damaging waste of our industrial activity.  \n",

More specifically, understanding these problems helps us understand the socioeconomic forces driving the emissions that are the source of the climate change problem.\n",

In other words, the `World3` model is not necessarily qualitatively predictive because it is missing some determining variables/model features (e.g. technology innovation/adaptation). It is thus almost certainly not predictive, but is still useful for thinking about 'world systems' because it includes important relationships between some key natural and socio-economic variables that we will look at here. In later tutorials, we will learn about similr critiques of elements of IAMs (e.g. for lacking important variables).*"

When a pathway comes back to itself, this is a termed a feedback pathway (or feedback loop) by which changes can be amplified or attenuated by the way the model couples distinct variables. Recall from W1D1 that there are two types of feedbacks: positives feedbacks (change in variable A causes a change in variable B, which in turn causes a change in variable A in the same direction as the initial change) and negative feedbaks (change in variable A causes a change in variable B, which in turn causes a change in variable A in the opposite direction as the initial change). \n",

    "### A note on exponential growth in a bounded system\n",
    "Consider a bounded system undergoing only positive feedback leading to exponential growth. The characteristic duration of growth until the system state reaches the system boundary is only weakly sensitive to the size of the boundary. For example, in the context of exponential resource-driven economic growth on Earth, reaching the boundary means exhausting its accessible physical resources. Ten times more or less of the starting amount of accessible resources only changes the time at which those resources are exhausted by a factor of 2 up or down, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Physics demands that behind the exponential extraction of resources is an exponential use of an energy resource. In recent times on Earth, this has been fossil fuels, which are non-renewable. Legitimate concerns of peak oil in the late 1990s were quelled by the Shale revolution in the United States and other technological advances in oil and gas exploration and exploitation. These have increased (by a factor between 2 and 4) the total amount of known reserves that can be profitably exploited. While this increase is significant on an linear scale, it is negligible on an exponential scale. Looking forward, the largest estimates for how much larger accessible oil and gas reserves will be are within an order of magnitude of current reserves. Presuming resource-driven growth economics continues, whatever accessible oil and gass is left will then be exhausted within a short period of time (e.g. within a century). \n",
    "\n",
    "Exponential growth in a bounded system will often slow as it reaches the boundary because of boundary-sized feedback effects. In our case, demand growth for fossil fuels is starting to slow with the development of renewable energy sources. There still substantial uncertainty about how these feedbacks will play out. Some questions to consider: \n",
    "- whether the transition to renewable energy sources can happen before we exhaust the associated non-renewable resources. \n",
    "- Once transitioned, whether the non-renewable resource use (e.g. of rare-earth metals) needed to sustain the renewable energy sector is sustainable in a growth-based economics\n",
    "- Once transitioned, whether this renewable energy resource might not slow, but instead accelerate the extraction of all non-renewable resources (see [Jevon's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox))."

This decline subsequently causes a decrease in food production (falling green), which causes an increase in the death rate (rising pink) and a decline in population (falling red) during the latter half of the 21st century. This scenario is resource-constrained because the collapse in growth that occured in the middle of the 21st century was initially driven by a decline in available resources.\n",

While a priori unclear, the origin of this discrepancy likely arises from the different values that were chosen for the many parameters as well as which components and interactions were assumed when designing a world model or IAM. One obvious difference is the assumption of continued economic growth (decoupled from resource use) in SSP2. The large prediction uncertainty inherent in this modelling activity limits its predictive power. However, characteristic mechanisms (e.g. feedback pathways) are shared across these very different models and imply characteristic phenomena (e.g. population saturation)."

    "In this tutorial, you explored a socio-economic model based on resource extraction. This is the conceptual basis of the world models within IAMs used in IPCC projections. \n",
    "\n",
    "You examined this interplay through `World3`, a *World model* which is a class of model similar to IAMs. You followed several variable dependency pathways within this model to identify some positive and negative feedback loops, and then you used this model to simulate 3 future scenarios which varied in their amount of initially available non-renewable resources and the lifetime of capital. Through these simulations you explored the factors driving current population growth, and its future projected decline or stabilization. In particular, you found rapid resource consumption can have negative impacts by exhausting these resources and/or by increasing pollution and reducing human health, thus highlighting the potential threats of unregulated resource extraction on a finite planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you learned about some of the limitations of models like `World3`, as they don't include some important natural and socio-economic variables. By exploring these complex concepts, you are now better equipped to engage with discussions on climate change, resource management, and sustainable economic growth."
