    "Today you have analyzed data from numerous cutting-edge & complex climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess projections of future climate under different socioeconomic & emission scenarios. In today’s videos, you saw some of the ways in which these scenarios differ from each other (e.g., emission rates & amounts, land use change), but one big question was not addressed. Why were these specific scenarios used for CMIP6? On W2D3, you will answer this question by delving into the socio-economic side of Earth’s future. Through this process you will explore the coupling between social sciences, politics, economics, and anthropogenic climate forcing."
