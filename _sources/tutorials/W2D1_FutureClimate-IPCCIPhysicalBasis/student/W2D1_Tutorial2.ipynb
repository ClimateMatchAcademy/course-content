    "In tutorial 2, you diagnosed changes at a global scale by calculating global mean timeseries with CMIP6 model mapped data. You then synthesized and compared global mean SST evolution in various CMIP6 experiments, spanning Earth's recent past and several future scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "We started by loading CMIP6 SST data from three different scenarios: *historical*, *SSP1-2.6* (low-emissions future), and *SSP5-8.5* (high-emissions future). This process expanded our understanding of model outputs. We then focused on calculating global mean SST, by taking into account the spatially-discrete and irregularly-gridded nature of this model's grid cells through a weighted mean. This weighted mean approach yielded the global mean SST, providing a holistic view of the Earth's changing sea surface temperatures under multiple future climate scenarios.\n"
