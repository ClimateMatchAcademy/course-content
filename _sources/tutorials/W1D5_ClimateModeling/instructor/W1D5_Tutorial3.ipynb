    "One of the crucial things missing from the simple model we have looked at so far is it's ability to change with time. As the composition of the atmosphere (among other things) changes with time, in response, so does the energy balance and global mean surface temperature. This is shown by the thick black lines in the figure below, where the time series of observed global mean surface air temperature change from the 1850-1900 reference period is plotted. Figures like this are called 'hockey stick' figures due to their shape: a relatively stable period followed by a steep increase. In order to incorporate this into our model, we need to include a mathetmatical representation of how the change in energy relates to a change in temperature over time.\n",

    "Figure 3.4 | Observed and simulated time series of the anomalies in annual and global mean surface air temperature (GSAT). All anomalies are differences from the 1850–1900 time-mean of each individual time series. The reference period 1850–1900 is indicated by grey shading. (a) Single simulations from CMIP6 models (thin lines) and the multi-model mean (thick red line). Observational data (thick black lines) are from the Met Office Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit dataset (HadCRUT5), and are blended surface temperature (2 m air temperature over land and sea surface temperature over the ocean). All models have been subsampled using the HadCRUT5 observational data mask. Vertical lines indicate large historical volcanic eruptions. CMIP6 models which are marked with an asterisk are either tuned to reproduce observed warming directly, or indirectly by tuning equilibrium climate sensitivity. Inset: GSAT for each model over the reference period, not masked to any observations. (b) Multi-model means of CMIP5 (blue line) and CMIP6 (red line) ensembles and associated 5th to 95th percentile ranges (shaded regions). Observational data are HadCRUT5, Berkeley Earth, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAAGlobalTemp-Interim and Kadow et al. (2020). Masking was done as in (a). CMIP6 historical simulations were extended with SSP2-4.5 simulations for the period 2015–2020 and CMIP5 simulations were extended with RCP4.5 simulations for the period 2006–2020. All available ensemble members were used (see Section 3.2). The multi-model means and percentiles were calculated solely from simulations available for the whole time span (1850–2020).

The impact of a doubling of carbon dioxide on these energy flows is measured by a [radiative forcing](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_AnnexVII.pdf). Here a positive radiation forcing leads to warming, and a negative radiative forcing leads to cooling.\n",

    "1. Write a function called step_forward() as from above, and then create another function that adds in a radiative forcing to the difference between ASR and OLR and call it step_forward_forced(). Make sure both functions output the energy balance of the model. Consistent with the [IPCC AR6](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-7/#Effective), use an effective radiative forcing of 3.93 $Wm^2$, where _effective_ means the climate system, but not the surface temperature, has been allowed to adjust.\n"

You learned how to calculate the heat capacity of these components and used this knowledge to develop a climate model. This model simulates the change in global mean surface temperature in response to energy imbalances. You explored the effects of transmissivity on the equilibrium temperature and discussed equilibrium climate sensitivity.\n"
