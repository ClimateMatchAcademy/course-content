    "Massive projects like CMIP6 can contain millions of datasets. For most practical applications we only need a subset of the data. To do this, we need to specify exactly which data sets we need. The naming conventions of CMIP6 data sets are standardized across all models and experiments, which allows us to load multiple related data sets with efficient code.\n",

    "   * in CMIP6 SST is called *tos*\n",
    "2. ***source_id***: The CMIP6 model(s) that we want data from \n",
    "3. ***table_id***: The origin system and output frequency desired of the variable(s) \n",
    "   * We use *Omon* - data from the ocean model at monthly resolution\n",
    "4. ***grid_id***: The grid that we want the data to be on\n",
    "   * We use *gn*  which is data on the model's *native* grid, some models also provide *gr* (*regridded* data) and other grid options\n",
    "5. ***experiment_id***: The CMIP6 experiments that we want to analyze\n",
    "   * We will load three experiments: *historical*, *ssp126* and *ssp585*. We'll discuss these more in the next few tutorials\n",
    "6. ***member_id***: this distinguishes simulations if the same model is run repeatedly for an experiment\n",

For each of these terms, there is an upwelling and downwelling component. This is because, for example, some of the downwelling shortwave radiation is reflected back upwards due to the surface albedo. Similarly, some upwelling longwave radiation from Earth is absorbed by the atmosphere and re-emitted back towards the surface. The net radiative flux is given as \n",

That is, positive indicates heat transport upwards and away from the surface.\n",

    "We will also be looking at latent and sensible heat. **[Sensible heat](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Sensible_heat)** is the heat transferred due to a temperature difference between touching materials, for example between the air and the land or ocean surface. In this case, if the surface air is warmer than the land/ocean then heat is transferred from the air to the land/ocean (which is a downward or negative sensible heat flux), with an opposite-direction transfer if the air was colder than the land/ocean.\n",

    "**[Latent heat](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Latent_heat)** is due to evaporation and condensation of water, as these phase changes absorb and release heat respectively.

The differences in the sensible heat flux seen here are largely caused by the different properties of the three main surface types: land, ocean, and ice. Land typically warms fast when exposed to insolation, the ocean has a much higher heat capacity so does not warm as much as land in response to insolation, and ice typically remains near zero degrees Celsius or colder. This means that land is often warmer than the surface air (strong positive sensible heat flux), the ocean and surface air often have a similar temperature (weak flux), and ice is often much cooler than surface air (strong negative flux)\n",

You analyzed data from a CESM simulation, focusing on how shortwave/longwave radiation, sensible and latent heat, contribute to the surface energy budget. This tutorial also explored the *zonal-mean* surface energy budget, elucidating how different surface heat flux components vary with latitude due to physical differences in air-surface conditions across regions."
