    "In this tutorial, we've learned about the principles of blackbody and greenhouse radiation models, which are crucial to understanding Earth's energy emission. We explored the concept of emission temperature and how it's calculated using observed outgoing longwave radiation. We discovered that the simple blackbody model needs to be augmented by considering the greenhouse effect to accurately represent Earth's observed surface temperature. This led us to incorporate the transmissivity coefficient, a representation of greenhouse gases' impact, into our model."
