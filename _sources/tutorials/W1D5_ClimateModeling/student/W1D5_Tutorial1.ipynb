In this model we assumed there is nothing that lies between Earth's surface and space that interacts with Earth's emitted radiation. From the initial lecture on the global energy budget we know this is not true. Earth has an atmosphere, and within it are many gases that interact with radiation in the infrared range at which Earth primarily emits. The effect of these gases on radiation, called the **[greenhouse effect](https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect#:~:text=As%20used%20in%20the%20field,absorb%20and%20emit%20infrared%20radiation.)**, is what warms earth to a habitable temperature.\n",

The figure below shows the contributions to the global surface air temperature change relative to 1750. We can see that all of these gases have contributed positively, that is towards warming Earth. Also note that the total curve tracks the volcano curve quite well until around the 1850s when industrialization took hold.

    "In this tutorial, we've learned about the principles of blackbody and greenhouse radiation models, which are crucial to understanding Earth's energy emission. We explored the concept of emission temperature and how it's calculated using observed outgoing longwave radiation. We discovered that the simple blackbody model needs to be augmented by considering the greenhouse effect to accurately represent Earth's observed surface temperature. This led us to incorporate the transmissivity coefficient, a representation of greenhouse gases' impact, into our model."
