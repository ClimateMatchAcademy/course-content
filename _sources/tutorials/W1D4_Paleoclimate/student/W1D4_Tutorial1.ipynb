    "# Section 1: Introduction to PAGES2k\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've now seen from introductory video, there are various types of [paleoclimate archives and proxies](http://wiki.linked.earth/Climate_Proxy) that can be used to reconstruct past changes in Earth's climate. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sediment Cores**: Sediments deposited in layers within lakes and oceans serve as a record of climate variations over time. Various proxies for past climate are preserved in sediment cores including, pollen, microfossils, charcoal, microscopic organisms, organic molecules, etc.\n",
    "- **Ice Cores**: Similarly to sediment cores, ice cores capture past climate changes in layers of ice accumulated over time. Common proxies for reconstructing past climate in ice cores include water isotopes, greenhouse gas concentrations of air bubbles in the ice, and dust.\n",
    "- **Corals**: Corals form annual growth bands within their carbonate skeletons, recording temperature changes over time. Scientists analyze the chemical composition of each layer to reconstruct temperature and salinity. Corals typically preserve relatively short paleoclimate records, but they provide very high-resolution reconstructions (monthly and seasonal) and are therefore valuable for understanding past changes in short-term phenomena.\n",
    "- **Speleothems**: These are cave formations that result from the deposition of minerals from groundwater. As the water flows into the cave, thin layers of minerals (e.g., calcium carbonate), are deposited. The thickness and chemical composition of speleothem layers can be used to reconstruct climate changes in the past.\n",
    "- **Tree Rings**: Each year, trees add a new layer of growth, known as a tree ring. These rings record changes in temperature and precipitation. Proxy measurements of tree rings include thickness and isotopes, which reflect annual variability in moisture and temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many existing paleoclimate reconstructions spanning a variety of timescales and from global locations. Given the temporal and spatial vastness of existing paleoclimate records, it can be challenging to know what paleoclimate data already exists and where to find it. One useful solution is compiling all existing paleoclimate records for a single climate variable (temperature, greenhouse gas concentration, precipitation, etc.) and over a specific time period (Holocene to present, the past 800,000 years, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of this is the **PAGES2k network**, which is a community-sourced database of temperature-sensitive proxy records. The database consists of 692 records from 648 locations, that are from a variety of archives (e.g., trees, ice, sediment, corals, speleothems, etc.) and span the Common Era (1 CE to present, i.e., the past ~2,000 years). You can read more about the PAGES2k network, in [PAGES 2k Consortium (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201788).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore the types of proxy records in the PAGES2k network and create a map of proxy record locations.\n"

You surveyed various types of paleoclimate proxies and archives available, in addition to crafting a global map pinpointing the locations of the PAGES2k proxy records. As you advance throughout this module, you will extract and meticulously analyze the temperature timelines embedded within reconstructions such as those shown here.\n"
