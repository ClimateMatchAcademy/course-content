    "As we discussed in the video, proxies and models both have advantages and limitations for reconstructing past changes in Earth's climate system. One approach for combining the strengths of both paleoclimate proxies and models is data assimilation. This is the same approach used in Day 2, except instead of simulations of Earth's recent past, we are using a simulation that spans many thousands of years back in time and is constrained by proxies, rather than modern instrumental measurements. The results of this process are called reanalysis products.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we'll look at paleoclimate reconstructions from the Last Glacial Maximum Reanalysis (LGMR) product from [Osman et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03984-4), which contains temperature for the past 24,000 years.\n",
