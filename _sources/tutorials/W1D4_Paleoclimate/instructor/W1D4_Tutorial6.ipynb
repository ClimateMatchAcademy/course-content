    "1. In the spectral analysis above, the 100 kyr and 40 kyr period are the most dominant. Here, we further see that over the past 1 million years, the 100 kyr cycle is the strongest (as seen by the yellow color at the 100 kyr scale), followed by the 40 kyr cycle (as seen by the light purple color at the 40 kyr scale). You may notice an absence of much color at the 23 kyr scale. What does this suggest about the influence of precession on glacial-interglacial cycles on this timescale?"

    "In this tutorial you learned how to analyze paleoclimate proxy datasets using spectral and wavelet analysis.  You were introduced to several spectral analysis methods, identified significant spectral peaks in the spectral density, and looked at the wavelet transform, it's evolution over time. By the end, you were able to determine the influence of various periods, like the 100 kyr and 40 kyr orbital cycles, on glacial-interglacial cycles."
