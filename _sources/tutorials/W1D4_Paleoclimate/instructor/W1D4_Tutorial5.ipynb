    "In this tutorial, you will explore various computational analyses for interpreting paleoclimate data and understand why these methods are useful. A common issue in paleoclimate is the presence of uneven time spacing between consecutive observations. `Pyleoclim` includes several methods that can deal with uneven sampling effectively, but there are certain applications and analyses for which it's ncessary to place the records on a uniform time axis. In this tutorial you'll learn a few ways to do this with `Pyleoclim`. Additionally, we will explore another useful paleoclimate data analysis tool, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which allows us to identify a common signal between various paleoclimate reconstructions. \n",

    "# **Section 3: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**\n",
    "Large datasets, such as global climate datasets, are often difficult to interpret due to their multiple dimensions. Although tools such as Xarray help us to organize large, multidimensional climate datasets, it can still sometimes be difficult to interpret certain aspects of such data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a tool for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets and  increasing interpretability with minimal modification or loss of data. In other words, PCA allows us to reduce the number of variables of a dataset, while preserving as much information as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in PCA is to calculate a matrix that summarizes how the variables in a dataset all relate to one another. This matrix is then broken down into new uncorrelated variables that are linear combinations or mixtures of the initial variables. These new variables are the **principal components**. The initial dimensions of the dataset determines the number of principal components calculated. Most of the information within the initial variables is compressed into the first components. Additional details about PCA and the calculations involved can be found [here](https://builtin.com/data-science/step-step-explanation-principal-component-analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied to paleoclimate, PCA can reduce the dimensionality of large paleoclimate datasets with multiple variables and can help us identify a common signal between various paleoclimate reconstructions. An example of a study that applies PCA to paleoclimate is [Otto-Bliesner et al., 2014](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1259531). This study applies PCA to rainfall reconstructions from models and proxies from throughout Africa to determine common climate signals in these reconstructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will calculate the PCA of four δD paleoclimate records from Africa to assess common climate signals in the four records.  In order to calculate the PCA of multiple paleoclimate time series, all of the records need to be on a common time-step. To do so, we can apply the resampling tools we've learned in this tutorial."

    "1. The overall trends are similar. However, there is more variability in the original δD records than in the PC1 time series. This makes sense because the principal component analysis identifies a common signal between original δD reconstructions and therefore is inherently less variable.\n",
    "2. The Gulf of Aden δD record is the most similar to the PC1 time series. The Lake Bosumtwi δD record is the least similar to the PC1 time series. This difference is particularly noticeable between 5,000-10,000 years ago.\n",
    "3. The PC1 time series suggests a drier climate (more positive δD) in Africa over the past 20,000 years. Recall that 20,000 years ago was the last glacial period. African rainfall increased ~15,000 years ago during the deglacial transition. There is a short period of drying ~12,000 years ago, which corresponds to the timing of the Younger Dryas (a millennial-scale, Northern Hemisphere high-latitude cooling event). This is followed by an increase in rainfall associated with what is known as the African Humid Period (a period of wet, humid conditions in northern and equatorial Africa, driven by intensification of the African monsoon). Finally, there is a decrease in rainfall over the past ~8,000 years towards the present. Note: δD only records qualitative changes in rainfall (i.e., wetter or drier relative to another time period), and does not provide quantitative measurements of the amount of rainfall.\n",
