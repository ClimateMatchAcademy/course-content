    "\n",
    "A common task in paleoclimatology is to relate a proxy record (or several of them) to the particular forcing(s) that is thought to dominate that particular record (e.g., based on the proxy, location, etc.). We've already spent some time in earlier tutorials learning about the influence of Earth's orbital configuration on glacial-interglacial cycles. In this tutorial, we'll assess the the climate forcings of monsoon intensity over the past 400,000 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the video that monsoons are seasonal changes in the direction of strongest wind and precipitation that are primarily driven by variations in seasonal insolation. Land and the ocean have different abilities to hold onto heat. Land cools and warms much faster than the ocean does due to high heat capacity. This temperature difference leads to a pressure difference that drives atmospheric circulations called monsoons. \n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Summer (Northern Hemisphere)**: land is warmer than the ocean, so the winds blow towards the land, resulting in heavy rainfall over land.\n",
    "*   **Winter (Northern Hemisphere)**: land is cooler than the ocean, so the winds blow away from the land, resulting in heavy rainfall over the ocean and decreased rainfall over land.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "On longer timescales, changes in insolation and the mean climate state can drive changes in monsoon intensity. To assess these long-term changes, we can analyze paleoclimate reconstructions from monsoon regions such as India, Southeast Asia or Africa.  δ<sup>18</sup>O records from speleothems in Chinese caves are broadly interpreted to reflect continental-scale monsoon circulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll plot and analyze a composite of three δ<sup>18</sup>O speleothem records from multiple caves in China (Sanbao, Hulu, and Dongge caves) from [Cheng et al. (2016)](https://hwww.nature.com/articles/nature18591). We will then assess the relationship between the climate signals recorded by the speleothem δ<sup>18</sup>O and solar insolation."

    "2. The relationship between solar insolation and monsoon intensity can be explained by the fact that solar insolation affects the temperature gradients between land and sea. During the summer, if there's high solar insolation, the land warms up more than the sea, leading to lower pressure over the land. This low pressure attracts moisture-rich air from the sea, causing the monsoon. Therefore, changes in solar insolation caused by Earth's orbital cycles could influence the intensity of monsoons. Specifically, the 23,000 year signal in these records suggests that precession-driven changes in insolation was the dominant forcing of monsoon intensity.\n",
