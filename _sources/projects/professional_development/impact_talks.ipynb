    "* These discussions will be an opportunity for students not only to delve deeper into the topics, but also to hone their leadership skills - all/most will get to lead the discussion, whether leading “from the front of from behind” \n",
    "* For each talk, please decide during “pod introduction” who will be the two leaders: \n",
    "    * One student/leader will be tasked with leading the discussion \"from the front\" by \n",
    "        (1) reading out loud and putting on the chat the prompt being addressed, \n",
    "        (2) answering discussion prompts at first until the group warms up and others wish to answer or offer thoughts first, and \n",
    "        (3) encouraging everyone in the group to participate in the best way that suits each person(*). \n",
    "    * One student/leader will be tasked with leading the discussion \"from behind\" by \n",
    "        (1) keeping an eye on who has the microphone and respectfully encouraging all to share it, \n",
    "        (2) asking along the way of answering the prompt if any others wish to contribute thoughts whether speaking or via chat/text (*), and \n",
    "        (3) keeping track of time (**).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remember that not everyone wishes to contribute to discussions in the same manner. Not all may wish to speak, but we want to provide space such that all have the opportunity to participate as they wish. Consider giving a few minutes to answer prompts individually and then share. Some may wish to draw or text instead of speaking, etc. and ideally both assigned leaders in the group can foster all kinds of participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will have 30 minutes to both watch the video and start engaging in discussion; at least one assigned leader will keep track of time. This doesn’t mean all the prompts will be answered, but rather they can all get group and individual reflections started.\n",

    "\n",
    "Climate justice is about economic equity, security and gender equality and allows us to address climate issues from deeper and more interconnected perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would find a balance between the countries of the Global North that emit more greenhouse gasses and those of the Global South that are more vulnerable to climate change. With this vision in mind, climate justice calls for climate action on three fronts: reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate change and payment for the losses and damages that it is already producing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand that climate justice will only be complete when it encompasses these three items. That is, when there is new and additional support and financing for vulnerable communities, not only for loss and damage, but also for adaptation and mitigation.\n",

She shares her view and definition of “equity” and how it plays a role in her career, professional work and generally in the things she does. She shares about an initiative she leads called “Climatewiki”, which is an incredible platform used to share in Spanish about the impact of climate change, in particular from the latinamerican lens. Additionally, Juliana shares inequities she has found as a climate scientists, steps she hs takin to address this, and how we might take positive action to support communities that have been impacted negatively by bad/inequitable practices such as harassment, sexual harassment, and others that happen in climate science. Lastly, Juliana shares some takeaways and what you could do to support equity in climate science and/or climate solutions from an equity lens.\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is the Psychology of the Climate Crisis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The climate crisis is the result of human behavior and, therefore, the science of Human Behavior Psychology is central to our understanding of why we are here. It addresses the question of what it is about human thought and behavior and the structures and systems that we have created that have led to the current crisis, why we are not responding as if we're in an emergency, and what we can do to change that. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Talk summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychological and behavioral explanations for the climate crisis are often centered on the quirky or flawed ways in which human cognition works. This includes our tendency to prioritize immediate rewards and satisfaction over future rewards, our tendency to be overly optimistic, and our decreased sensitivity to threats that happen far away or far in the future. \n",
    "This narrative is very problematic because it essentially justifies the climate and biodiversity crisis as an inevitable product of universal human nature. A more productive view focuses on how social norms and the perceived belief of others shape human behavior and how effective communication about climate change and our own beliefs and actions can influence the behavior of individuals, communities, industry and policy makers.\n",

Sometimes, awareness starts a snowball effect in addressing inequities, sometimes it takes more than that. From the video and discussion in your group, what is one small little action you might implement to contribute to climate science communication and decrease the stigma of the psychological implications of the climate crisis?"
