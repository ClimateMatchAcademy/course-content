# Mentor Meetings


Our mentors have several years of experience working in any climate-related discipline, including industry, academia, government, non-profits, journalism, and science communication.

They will visit project groups to speak about their professional path, share career advice, and provide a networking opportunity for the students.

Teaching Assistants are welcome to attend up to two meetings with mentors as part of their working hours.


## Suggested meeting structure (~60 minutes)


### Introduction: 10 minutes

Every student introduces themselves, shares what brings them to Climatematch Academy, and how they hope to use what they experience during the course in the near future. This will help students make more specific connections by the end of the hour.


### Mentor's Journey and Lessons: 10 minutes

The mentor talks about who they are, what they have done and still do, any lessons they have learned, and the message they wish to share with the group.


### Questions and Answers: 30 minutes

These are some questions that can be used as prompts: 

* General career-related questions:
    * In your own opinion, what qualifications and background are required to succeed in your area of work?
    * What are the biggest obstacles and opportunities you see in your field right now?
    * How important would you say that diversity, equity, and inclusion are in your field?
    * How can one acquire the practical experience required to enter your field?
    * What do you wish you had known when you started working in your field?
* Specific career-related questions (might not be relevant to all mentors):
    * How do you go about explaining difficult topics in your field to the public or decision-makers? Are there any particular difficulties or concerns you have faced?
    * Do you have any suggestions for successful methods to close the gap between climate research and climate action?
    * Can you shed any light on how interdisciplinary climate science is and the significance of working with other disciplines?
* General climate questions:
    * In your opinion, how can climate justice be actualised and what are the major challenges (if you agree that there are)?
    * How do you anticipate the climate will change?
    * Can you suggest other mitigation and adaptation measures especially for the traditionally under-represented regions of the world?
    * Are there any international partnerships or groups that, in your opinion, are particularly crucial to advancing the study of climate science and tackling climate challenges?
    * Can you offer any tips or techniques for efficiently presenting climate science to various audiences, including skeptics or individuals with little prior knowledge of the subject?
    * What else should people, communities, and governments do in your opinion to lessen the effects of climate change and prepare for them?
    * What practical steps can one take to foster collaboration between climate-related disciplines? How important is it in your opinion?


### Networking and Collaboration: 10 minutes

Using the information shared in the meeting, what are some specific ways the group could connect further?
