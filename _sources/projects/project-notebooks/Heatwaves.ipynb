    "The atmosphere and land are entwined components of the Earth's system, constantly exchanging energy, mass, and momentum. Their interaction contributes to a variety of physical and biological processes. Understanding of the dynamic interactions between atmosphere and land is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change, such as land-use changes and hazards ranging from droughts, floods, and even fluctuation in agricultural production and products ([Jach et. al., 2022](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/13/109/2022/); [Ogwu et. al. 2018](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325142745_Economics_of_Soil_Fertility_Management_Practices_in_Nigeria); [Dirmeyer et. al. 2016](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/99/6/bams-d-17-0001.1.xml)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Climate change is also expected to have a significant impact on cereal production around the world. Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events can all affect crop yields, as well as the timing and quality of harvests. For example, higher temperatures can lead to reduced yields for crops like wheat and maize, while changes in rainfall patterns can result in droughts or floods that can damage crops or delay planting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better understand the relationship between climate change and cereal production, researchers have begun to explore the use of environmental monitoring data, including air temperature and soil moisture, to help identify trends and patterns in crop production. By collecting and analyzing this data over time, it may be possible to develop more accurate models and predictions of how climate change will affect cereal production in different regions of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that while environmental monitoring data can provide valuable insights, there are many other factors that can affect cereal production, including soil quality, pests and diseases, and agricultural practices. Therefore, any efforts to correlate cereal production with climate change must take into account a wide range of factors and be based on robust statistical analyses in order to ensure accurate and reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this project**, you will look into how specific climate variables represent and influence our changing climate. In particular,you will explore various climate variables from model data to develop a more comprehensive understanding of different drivers of heatwaves (periods during which the temperature exceeds the climatological average for a certain number of consecutive days over a region larger than a specified value). You will further use this data to understand land-atmosphere interactions, and there will also be an opportunity to relate the aforementioned climate variables to trends in cereal production."
